## What is this Data?
Here you will find information about persons, places, literary works, and bibliographic items mentioned in or related to the *History of Physicians* (ʿUyūn al-Anbāʾ fī Ṭabaqāt al-Aṭibbāʾ), a biographical dictionary of physicians and scholars written by Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa (died 668 AH/1269 or 1270 CE). These entries are used to create networks showing the possible relationships or interactions between people. You can also take a look at the text of Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa's work, where we've tagged the people, places, and works he mentions with URIs identifying them.
