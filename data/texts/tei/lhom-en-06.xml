                            This was done systematically: each day, the masters would agree on a particular passage, and it was that passage that would be read and explicated that day. Subsequently, however, they made summaries and abridgements of the books so they were easily committed to memory and readily understandable. At a still later date, each of the seven Alexandrians composed his own commentary on the Sixteen Books.

Philoponus was not however himself a bishop and he died around 575 so the John the Grammarian who was alive at the time of the conquest of Egypt by ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ is a different figure, whose chronology was falsely aligned with that of Philoponus (see below).

The modern historical literature tends to speak of

So ably did he argue his case, however, that his accusers were quite won over: they sought to conciliate him, asking him in respectful terms to renounce the position he had adopted and to desist from proclaiming it. In vain: he stood his ground, and in the end he was removed from his office.

Philoponus (ca. 490–575), was a pupil of Ammonius (see here below) and was sometimes known as ‘the Grammarian’ (cf. e.g.

He also wrote theology from a monophysite perspective and was later condemned for his interpretation of the Trinity (cf.

He was captivated at once, and began to look into the domain of learning. Once he realized what it entailed, he reflected, ‘Here I am, over forty years old, with no skill of any kind. All I know how to do is pilot this wherry. How can I possibly hope to succeed at any aspect of learning?’ As these thoughts were running through his mind, what should he see but an ant that was trying to carry a date pit up a slope. It lost its grip on its burden repeatedly and saw it roll back down, but it persisted indefatigably, and by degrees got the pit higher and higher up the slope. The struggle continued all day long as John watched in fascination, and in the end the insect succeeded in dragging the date pit up to where it wanted it. At this, John the Grammarian said to himself, ‘If a tiny creature as feeble as this can attain its goal through persistent effort, surely I can do as well, or better.’ He sold his wherry forthwith, entered the Museum, and embarked on the study of grammar, language and logic, in all of which he proved to be outstandingly brilliant. He was dubbed ‘the Grammarian’ (

                                            Eutyches, a Constantinopolitan archimandrite with monophysite beliefs, played a key role in the Christological battles of the first half of the 5th cent. before the death of his protector, Theodosius

However within a few months Eutyches was able to have himself restored to communion and intrigued to secure the deposition of Flavian at the ‘Robber’ Council of Ephesus (449) under the presidency of the archbishop of Alexandria, Dioscorus. After Theodosius’ death, however, the late emperor’s sister Pulcheria and her consort Marcian rejected the monophysite leanings of the previous regime, confined and then banished (

The physician was consulted in the case, examined the Emperor, and treated him, and in due course he recovered from his illness. ‘Ask for what you will,’ said the grateful Emperor. ‘Imperial Majesty,’ replied Eutyches, ‘there is indeed something that you can do for me. The Bishop of Dorylaeum and I have become enemies. He has treated me unjustly, having encouraged the Patriarch of Constantinople, Archbishop Flavian,

Dioscorus obeyed, with thirteen bishops in his train, but the Patriarch of Antioch procrastinated and in the end did not appear.

                                    The Emperor therefore instructed Dioscorus to examine Eutyches’ case and withdraw the pronunciation of anathema unconditionally. ‘If you withdraw the pronunciation of anathema,’ said the Emperor to him menacingly, ‘I shall reward you generously and abundantly, and if you do not I shall have you put to death painfully.’ The Patriarch, having decided that being rewarded was preferable to being put to death, convened a conclave consisting of himself and his thirteen bishops, together with the other prelates who had accompanied them. Taking a lenient view of the matter, they declared the pronunciation of anathema withdrawn. At that, the bishop of Dorylaeum and his colleagues walked out and left Constantinople.

However he shows omissions and additions, and it may be that the Chester Beatty represents a slightly different recension of a work that is of considerable importance for its personal details and reports of teaching practices in Fatimid Cairo.

                                    For the first level, they would use the books as an introduction to the art of medicine. Following attainment of that level, the novice would be ready to perform simple medical procedures. If he had the time and was sufficiently motivated, he could pursue his studies further. Even if he did not, he could hardly fail to be aware of the advantages he had in terms of treating diseases.

                                    At this level, only four of the books were used. The first of these was

                                    , a single volume, which sets forth the principles governing treatment followed by the Empiricists and those followed by the Dogmatists. After all, people learn about all matters relating to the various arts either from experience or reason. Where the outcome of those approaches is the same, the answer must be correct; where the outcome is not the same, further investigation is required. Dogmatists and Empiricists will apply their respective methods to that end.

                                    , again a single volume, setting forth all the useful information that the student could obtain about various diseases by taking the patient’s pulse.

                                    Every fledgling physician performing simple procedures must necessarily possess some knowledge of the potential actions of the foods and medications that he needs, and must be able to perform such procedures with his own hands. Accordingly, it is incumbent upon him to look into such of the works listed at the end of Galen’s
                                    <hi rend="italic">Small Art</hi>
                                    , or else acquire the knowledge from his teachers and through his own observation.

                                    At the second level, again, four of Galen’s Sixteen Books were used. The first of these was
                                    <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi>
                                    , a single volume, which explains that the human body and everything within it that it requires are subject to sudden change and alteration. This is an observation that is applicable to the primary elements of the body, that is, the homoeomerous parts: the bones, the nerves, the arteries and veins, the membranes, the flesh, the fat, and so on.

                                    , in five volumes. Galen had originally composed these as separate works, but the Alexandrians combined them into a single one. This book sets forth descriptions of the homoeomerous parts of the body, their number, and all their requirements.

                                    At the third level, only a single work was used:
                                    <hi rend="italic">Causes and Symptoms</hi>
                                    , consisting of six treatises. Galen had originally composed those treatises as separate works, but the Alexandrians combined them into a single book. It explains diseases, their causes, and the symptoms characteristic of various disorders. This is an immensely informative work on the art of medicine in accordance with the Dogmatic doctrine. It is indispensable, and anyone who has mastered its contents and understood it is familiar with every aspect of that art.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the fourth level, two works were used. The first of these was the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Classification of the Diseases of the Internal Parts</hi>
                                    , in six volumes, which explains the various disorders affecting the parts inside the body. Such disorders are not perceptible to the sight, being concealed from view, they can be detected only by symptoms, each of which must be assessed by the physician. Where these are present, he can be certain that a particular part is harbouring a specific disorder. Pleurisy, by way of illustration, is a hot swelling affecting the pleura, the membrane underlying the ribs. The symptoms that can be assessed are shortness of breath, stabbing pain, fever, and cough. Where all these are present, the physician may conclude that there is a hot swelling affecting the pleura.
                                </p>
                                <p>Galen never composed a work on disorders affecting external parts of the body, for the simple reason that such disorders are plainly visible. The fledgling physician can thus diagnose them through observation in the presence of his masters.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The second of the Sixteen Books that was used at the fourth level was the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Great Book of the Pulse</hi>
                                    . This work is divided into four parts, each of them consisting of four volumes. Part one sets forth information about the various kinds of pulse, with detailed descriptions of each kind. Part two explains how to identify the several kinds, part three provides information about the causes of each, and part four describes the utility of each. This is a highly useful means of identifying disorders and discovering whether the patient’s body has sufficient strength to withstand his particular disorder.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the fifth level, three works were used. The first of these was
                                    <hi rend="italic">Fevers</hi>
                                    , in two volumes. From this work, the student acquired knowledge of the natures of the several types of fevers and the symptoms characteristic of each type.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The second work used at this level was
                                    <hi rend="italic">Crises</hi>
                                    , in three volumes. From it the student learned about the times of diseases, and was thus enabled to administer treatment that was appropriate at every time. He also learned to recognize, for every disorder, the tendency of the patient’s condition, that is, whether he was likely to recover or not, and how and through what means. The third work was
                                    <hi rend="italic">Critical Days</hi>
                                    , also in three volumes. From this work, the student acquired knowledge of the times of the crisis, the days on which it would occur, and its causes and symptoms.

Furthermore, their order of progression was defective, for Galen himself began with the subject of anatomy and went on from there to discuss properties and functions before proceeding to the elements.’</p>

                                <p>(Continuing the words of Abū l-Faraj) I myself consider that the reason why the Alexandrians limited their curriculum to Galen’s Sixteen Books was not that they regarded their content as sufficient for an understanding of the art of medicine and an adequate means to that end but rather because those books require a teacher and commentator. No student could possibly grasp their finer points and underlying meanings if he did not have the benefit of interaction with his master, including discussion, repetition and investigation.</p>
                                <p>
                                    To be sure, every physician must be familiar with the works mentioned by my learned master, Abū l-Khayr ibn al-Khammār, in addition to those listed above. However, he will be able to understand them and master their contents unaided, owing to his knowledge of the Sixteen Books, which will serve as a foundation on which to build and a ladder by which to ascend to the others. And should you ask me about the Alexandrians’ reasons for teaching the Sixteen Books in a particular order, I answer that in some cases a work was given priority because of its inherent value, such as
                                    <hi rend="italic">The Sects</hi>
                                    , which was placed ahead of the others because it served to dispel from the student’s mind any doubts about the fallacies of the Empiricists and the Methodists while simultaneously showing him the truth of the Dogmatist doctrine and explaining why he should follow that doctrine. Similarly,
                                    <hi rend="italic">The Small Art of Medicine</hi>
                                    contains the essential sparks of the medical art, and consequently it was rightly placed after
                                    <hi rend="italic">The Sects</hi>
                                    and made an introduction to that art.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In some cases, the Alexandrians placed the works where they did in the curriculum because they were closely related to other works.
                                    <hi rend="italic">The Small Book of the Pulse</hi>
                                    , for example, came after
                                    <hi rend="italic">The Small Art of Medicine</hi>
                                    because Galen discusses the pulse in that work as well, in the passage dealing with the temperament of the heart.

                                <p>On the other hand, the order of works which my learned master Abū l-Khayr says was originally indicated by Galen is, by my life, the order appropriate to the art itself, for every man who sets out to master an art must proceed by degrees from what is evident to what is recondite, and from final outcomes to first principles. Now, anatomy is knowledge of the body and its parts, and while those are what first strike our attention when we observe a human being, they are the last stage of Nature’s work. Nature begins with elements, which she mixes into humours; only then does she fashion faculties and limbs. In seeking to learn about the art of medicine, we ought to retrace Nature’s course in reverse. In practice, we do not follow this procedure as we should do, but rather settle for the programme of study laid down by the Alexandrians. After all, the student acquires knowledge in any case, and to disregard the consensus of the sages of antiquity is accounted folly.</p>
