For when he began his career he found the art of medicine was dominated by the teaching of charlatan physicians and its excellent characteristics were being erased.

On this group, see Nutton index s.v. and below, 5.1.19, further Ch. 4.1.10.4 on Galen’s incineration of the Methodists’ writings. One of the leading Methodists was the famous gynaecologist, Soranus of Ephesus, whom Galen in fact held in high regard. Cf. 5.1.37 no. 101.

                            He took the problem in hand and showed that the doctrines of people like that were useless. He championed and invigorated the arguments and teachings of Hippocrates and his successors. It was as a result of his abilities that this was the medicine that triumphed. He composed many treatises on it and through these he clarified many of the obscurities of the art and gave eloquent expression to its truths, allowing medicine’s real language to prevail. Physicians who lived after him were inferior and dependent on him for their learning.

                            This matter requires careful scrutiny for information on it cannot be restricted, as has been indicated. Indeed, logic dictates that some of it is inconceivable and this includes his information that Galen was a youth and a student for seventeen years and a scholar and a teacher for seventy years. The only way to check what he says is to use the reports of Galen himself. Following statements by someone like Galen about himself is preferable to following the words of someone else about him. Here is the actual text Galen wrote in his volume on

Next he sent me to learn logic, with the intention that at this age I should be studying philosophy alone. He then had a dream which directed him to have me instructed in medicine and he sent me to study it when I had reached the seventeenth year of my age.

                                     622), which would put his death in 97/98. (It is possible that Isḥāq, working in solar years, took 815 from 902/3, thus reckoning Galen’s death in 87/88.) Given Galen’s assumed lifespan of 87 years, he could thus make Galen a close coeval of Christ. The errors of Isḥāq are examined later with the help of ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Jibrīl, cf. Ch. 5.1.12.

                            But I note that the birth of Galen was fifty-nine years after the time of Christ according to the dates given by Isḥāq.

Shafīʿ i.28, 30–31, trans. Meyerhof, ‘Bayhaqī’ 147). See further 5.1.21 for the story (from Ibn Juljul) of Galen dying in Sicily on his way to visit Jesus in Jerusalem. Ibn Juljul’s contemporary Bar Bahlūl records in his lexicon (ed. Duval i.958, ll. 3–11) that ‘some say Luke was Galen’s pupil, others the son of his sister. When they heard the news of our Lord – that in Judaea there was a man who was performing extraordinary cures without any assistance from medicine – he and his master Galen doubted that the story was true … So they set off for Judaea to find out the truth. Galen died on the way, but Luke reached the Lord.’ On this, see Vol. 1 of the present study, p. 152.

For had King Philadelphus not doubted his translation, he would not have taken the precautionary measures mentioned or shown so much enthusiasm for ensuring the reliability of the translation. If he had entertained no suspicions about his version, there would have been no reason to be cautious because, having appointed people in the first place, it was natural to reappoint them a second time. But since he wanted to check his interpretation, he acted as described, undertook the comparison, and produced a corrected text. On this basis we should conclude that the chronology of the Greeks is the most correct – I mean the chronology of the Torah and the Prophets that they used.</p>

                                    The reign of King Philadelphus lasted for thirty-eight years. He was the third king after Alexander, taking account of the fact that the era of Alexander begins with his killing of Darius, that the duration of Alexander’s rule was six years and that the calendar of the Greeks begins from this point.

The ‘era of the Greeks’ probably refers to what we call the ‘Seleucid Era’, a dating system instituted by the Seleucid empire some years later (in the eastern part of their dominion from 312/11 and in the western parts, later falling under Roman control, from the following year), which continued dating by the regnal years of Alexander’s general, Seleucus. The system was the most widely and continuously used of the ‘dynastic’ eras and we find it attested well into the Middle Ages: Leschhorn,

                                    In his chronicle Andronicus records that Galba became king after Nero for seven months, Vitellius for eight, and Otho for three. The next to rule was Vespasian Caesar for ten years. At the end of his reign he launched an attack on Jerusalem, sacked it, and transferred all the ritual implements of the House to Constantinople.

It was Trajan who recovered Antioch from the Persians. His deputy in Palestine wrote to him saying that, ‘The more Christians I kill, they more grow to love their religion’, and so Trajan gave orders to stay the sword from them.

                                    <hi rend="italic">Anatomical Procedures</hi>
                                    . In the passage concerned he says, ‘I had previously written a book on anatomical procedures during my first visit to the city of Rome at the start of the reign of king Antoninus, who is still king in our time’.

The earlier book of the same title does not survive. By Antoninus Galen in fact refers to the emperor we call Marcus Aurelius (cf. his own explanation quoted below, 5.1.9), who began his reign in 161 and took the additional name Antoninus in honour of his adoptive father and predecessor, Antoninus Pius (who is omitted). Galen’s first visit to Rome was 162–166.

But at that point a letter written by the two kings arrived from the city of Aquileia with instructions that I should set out because they had decided to winter at Aquileia and then proceed against the Germans. So I was forced to travel to them. However I had hopes of being excused if I requested it since I had been informed that of the two of them the one called Verus was seen as having an agreeable character and a gentle disposition. When king Antoninus who ruled after Hadrian designated Verus his successor, he had him share power with a man called Lucius, to whom he gave the name Verus. The original Verus was renamed Antoninus.</p>

                                    When I reached Aquileia, there was an outbreak of plague on a scale not seen before. Both kings fled to Rome with most of their entourage but the main army remained at Aquileia. Some of them perished and some survived. The fact that they had a very tough time was not simply due to the plague but also because it fell on them in the middle of winter. Lucius died on the journey and Antoninus carried his body to Rome and buried him there.

                                    I then waited for him to return to Rome, for he was expecting the war to be over soon. He departed leaving behind his son Commodus, a small boy. He ordered those who attended to his personal service and upbringing to make every effort to preserve his health. If he should fall ill, they were to summon me to assume control over his treatment.

                                    Martialius had written two treatises on anatomy that are circulating even today and were very much admired at the time I was writing. He was a spiteful individual with a taste for vindictive and argumentative behaviour quite out of keeping with his advanced age for he was well over seventy. When he heard that I had been quizzed in a public assembly about a problem in anatomy and had been commended for my answer, and that the whole audience had shown its appreciation and lavished its praise on me, he asked one of our friends to say which of the several medical sects I claimed to belong to. He replied that I was known for having no personal affiliation to any particular sect, but ‘he says that “

                                    One day it happened that I was attending a public assembly to be examined on my proficiency in the books of the ancients. The set text was Erasistratus’
                                    <hi rend="italic">Bringing Up Blood</hi>
                                    . A stylus was inserted into it in the usual way and rested at the point where Erasistratus rejected the use of venesection.

                                    I said a good deal against Erasistratus in order to annoy Martialius, who claimed to be his follower. The audience were full of admiration. One of my supporters who was an enemy of Martialius requested that I should dictate the lecture I had given at the meeting to a scribe he sent to me with a training in shorthand so that he could repeat it to Martialius whenever he encountered him with patients.

                                    I was unhappy about it because the tone of the lecture was competitive. It was written for an occasion when I had wanted to trounce Martialius in a particular public forum, not to mention the fact that I had been a young man of thirty at the time.

                                    I would no longer lecture or give displays in public – for I had won more successes and triumphs in treating patients than I could have wished for.

Rather I would confine myself to demonstrating my extensive knowledge of medicine through my activity in treating the sick.

                                    If we add to this total the lifespan of Galen and the interval between his birth and Christ’s ascension to Heaven, i.e. 160 years, the grand total, I mean from Christ’s ascension to this year we are in, would come to 1107 years.

                                    This total is wrong for it is defective once one goes into the details. As a result of this sort of chronology people fall into error since they blindly follow the authors of the chronicles and go astray. The nature of the error in the totalling is twofold. First is the dating of Christ and second the dating of Galen. We have addressed both of these in unequivocal terms in the preceding account. If anyone wishes to examine the issue, let him refer to it and the matter will become obvious to him from the details provided. For Christ was born 1018 years ago, and Galen 913 years ago.

                                    This represents a major discrepancy from Isḥāq’s account in particular by introducing a crucial difference relating to what he says about the death of Galen. If we take Isḥāq’s report that his lifespan was eighty-seven years, it must be the case that his death fell in the year mentioned, i.e. 516 of (the era of) Alexander, assuming a date of birth in 429 of this era.

                                            we observe that the people who are called Christians base their faith on myths and miracles, though their actions look like those of philosophers, for example with regard to their fearlessness of death and the things they will encounter after it, and we see this on a daily basis. Another example is their abstention from sexual intercourse and the fact that some of them, not only men but women too, spend the days of their life refraining from intercourse. In certain cases self-control in the regulation of food and drink has led to harm. Their desire to be just is so strong that they are not inferior to those who are really philosophers.

                                    We have learned from this passage that in the time of Christ Christians did not visibly assume this image, I mean the asceticism and preference for devoting themselves to God (May He Be Glorified and Exalted!) that Galen describes. But a century later Christians had become so widespread that they surpassed philosophers in good deeds. They aimed at justice, grace, and continence. They achieved success by justifying miracles. They enjoyed a double condition, were the heirs to a double status, and rejoiced in a double bliss: the happiness of the Law and the happiness of the Intellect.

May he please grant this! He laughed at my words and said, “Woe betide you, Jibrīl!

For I know he hates the thought of having to provide them with food and drink!” So I said, There is no actual need for me to visit Galen’s house! At that he laughed even more: “Upon Ibn al-Mahdī’s honour, you will certainly carry this out, with a thousand horsemen at your side!” ’

                                    Jibrīl went on. ‘I was the most sorrowful and the unhappiest of men as I left, for I had not even prepared for myself the wherewithal to cater for ten. The situation was not resolved until all the bread, carcasses and salt were delivered to me.

                                    It was enough for all those with me and a lot was left! And so I did indeed get to stay in that place and eat there. The young men of the army went and raided the wine and meat stores of the Romans. They ate the meat sliced on bread and drank wine with it. I withdrew at the end of the day. Ibrāhīm ibn al-Mahdī asked me, “Was anything obvious in the layout of Galen’s house to show that he enjoyed honour?” Yes, the layout was extensive. I saw it had ranges to the east, west, and south, but I did not see one pointing north.

                                    This was the way Roman philosophers built their houses, and we know the Persian nobility used the same style. And I am planning the same, if I am true to myself and do what I should. For any house that lacks sunshine is prone to disease. Galen was in the service of the Roman kings because of his wisdom and the Roman kings were men of ambition in everything they did. If you were to compare Galen’s dwelling with (other) Roman dwellings, you would appreciate its large area and the size of its buildings. Although I only saw it in a dilapidated condition, from the fact that I found ranges with intact roofs I could tell he was a man who enjoyed high honour.’

                                    said, My dear Jibrīl, the kings of the Romans were indeed men of ambition, as you have described, but the ambition they showed in their gifts and presents was no different from the ambition they showed in their personal honours. This failing affects servant and served. If you consider the plot occupied by the palace of the king of Rome and the plot owned by Galen, then consider the palace of the Commander of the Faithful and your own residence, the ratio of Galen’s residence to that of the king of Rome will resemble the ratio between your own and the residence of the Commander of the Faithful!

                                <p>Jibrīl was sometimes impressed by my often penetrating claims and praised me in front of Ibrāhīm ibn al-Mahdī, but at other times he was annoyed and flew into a temper. Thus he said, ‘What has your mention of “ratio” got to do with me?’ I replied ‘By mentioning “ratio” I deliberately used a technical term from the discourse of the Roman sages. You are their leading student and I intended to make things relevant to you by speaking the language of your masters. The point of my remark that the ratio of Galen’s estate to the king of Rome’s estate resembles the ratio of your estate to the Commander of the Faithful’s estate is this: if Galen’s estate is a half or a third or a fourth or a fifth or some such proportion, does its proportion relative to the king of Rome’s estate resemble that of your estate in relation to the Commander of the Faithful’s estate, or is it less? Suppose that the estate of the Commander of the Faithful were one parasang by one parasang and the proportion of yours was a tenth of a parasang by a tenth of a parasang, and that the estate of the king of Rome was a tenth of a parasang by a tenth of a parasang and Galen’s estate was a tenth of a tenth of a parasang by a tenth of a tenth of a parasang. In that case the proportion of Galen’s estate in relation to the king of Rome’s estate would resemble the relationship between the scale of your house and that of the Commander of the Faithful exactly.’</p>

But every one of the companions of the king of Rome lived in a state of poverty and enjoyed little influence. So how could Jibrīl possibly be like Galen who enjoyed no privileges because his father was a husbandman and a keeper of parks and gardens?

The caliphs have bestowed gifts upon me and raised me up from the rank of physician to their own company and companionship. And if I said that the Commander of the Faithful has no brother or relative or commander or governor who does not treat me right without being disposed to do so out of love for me – and whether he is so disposed or grateful to me for some treatment I gave him or a brilliant occasion where I was in attendance or a flattering story I told at court to his advantage, well, all of these people lavish their benefactions and gifts upon me. But if the size of my house is ten per cent of the house of the Commander of the Faithful and the Galen’s is one per cent of the house of the king of Rome – he was still much more distinguished than me!’

By God I was angry at the thought of being Galen’s equal in any situation. I am thankful for his precedence over me in each and every circumstance!’ Ibn al-Mahdī was pleased and expressed his approval by saying, ‘Upon my life this is a fine thing in men of freedom and culture!’ At this Jibrīl fell down to kiss his feet but he stopped him and embraced him instead.</p>

                                    I learned the demonstrative method from the time of my youth, and more importantly I rejected pleasures at the start of my study of medicine, despising and repudiating the worldly trappings people fight over, so that I excused myself the trouble of getting up early to attend at men’s doors in order to accompany them as they rode out from their residences and waiting around by the doors of kings so that we might escort them to their palaces and stay by their side. Nor did I waste my time or upset myself wandering around after men, which people call ‘greeting’.

                                    Instead I devoted my time entirely to practising medicine and to reflecting and thinking about it. I generally stayed up at nights to explore the treasures left us by the ancients. If anyone can say he acted as I did and possesses the natural intelligence and quick understanding that allow familiarity with this great science, he ought to be trusted even before people encounter his diagnoses and conduct with patients, and he should be judged superior to those who lack the talents we have specified and the practices we have listed.

                                    despite the fact I was not yet thirty years of age. Before this two or three senior figures had been entrusted with the task of dealing with them. When he was asked about the method he used to examine me in order to establish if he could trust me and put me in charge, he said, ‘I happened to observe that he spent more days teaching this science than other, older physicians had spent learning it. More to the point, I saw them wasting their lives to no purpose; but I did not see him waste a single day or night of his life on useless pursuits nor was there a day or an occasion when he took time off from training himself in things of benefit. We also observed him at work recently, and this is a better guide to his proficiency in the art than the many years of those senior physicians.’

                                <p>I once attended one of the public meetings where people assemble to find out more about a physician’s knowledge. I demonstrated many examples of dissection to the audience including one where I took an animal and split open its belly to pull out the intestines. I called on the physicians who were present to replace them and suture the belly in the correct manner. Not one of them ventured to do this. We took care of it ourselves and thereby revealed our skill, experience, and dexterity. We also intentionally opened some of the major veins so the blood flowed and called upon the senior physicians to deal with them – but they had nothing to offer. Again I dealt with them myself and it became clear to anyone of intelligence in the audience that a man who was to be in charge of the wounded must possess the skills I did. When the high priest made me responsible for their affairs – and he was the first to give me this job – he was absolutely delighted because none of the many men in my care died, barring two individuals, whereas sixteen had died in the care of the physician before me. Later a second high priest put me in charge and he was even luckier as a result of the appointment because not one of those under me died although they had many very serious injuries.</p>
                                <p>I mention all this to show how somebody wanting to conduct an examination may do so to distinguish between the expert physician and his opposite before his theories and knowledge are tested out on patients. The examination must not be conducted as people do nowadays: they prefer physicians who ride with them and focus on serving them to such a degree that they have no time left for practising medicine. Rather, preferring and choosing medicine requires someone very different. His time must be completely focussed on the practice of medicine and on nothing else.</p>
                                <p>I happen to know an intelligent and perceptive man who showed me favour on account of seeing a single performance of mine. It involved me dissecting an animal to demonstrate which organs were responsible for the voice and which for locomotion. Two months earlier this man had fallen from a height. He broke many of his limbs and his voice largely failed so that his speech was reduced to a whisper. His limbs were treated, recovered, and restored to health after many days but his voice would not return. However, after observing my demonstration, he gained confidence in me and appointed me to deal with his problem. I cured him in a few days because I identified the affected area and gave it my attention.</p>

                                <p>I know another man who was crushed when he fell off his horse. He was treated and recovered from all his problems except that two of his fingers – the little finger and the ring finger – remained numb for a long period. He had hardly any feeling in them and lacked normal control over their movement. There was also something wrong with the middle finger. The physicians applied various dressings without success and every time they applied one they had to change it for another. When he consulted me I asked him which part of his body he had landed on. He told me that he had landed on a spot right between his shoulder blades. I was aware from my study of anatomy that the root of the nerve which ends in those two fingers is located in the first of the vertebrae between the shoulder blades, and I realized that the cause of the trouble lay at the spot where this nerve emerges from the spinal cord. So I applied at this spot some of the dressings that had been placed on the fingers after requesting the removal of those applications, which were useless. It was not long before he was cured, and everyone who saw this was astounded by the fact that the area between the shoulder blades can cure and restore the fingers!</p>

                                    Someone else who consulted me was suffering from the loss of both his voice and his appetite for food. I cured him with medicines which I applied to his neck. His symptoms were as follows. He had a very bad case of scrofula on both sides of the neck. One of his carers had treated it by excising the scrofulous tissue. But as a result of inattentiveness he had exposed to the cold the two nerves adjacent to the two arteries that are prominent in the neck. These two nerves ramify out to many parts of the body and a major branch reaches the ‘mouth’

                                    of the stomach. From it the whole stomach acquires sensation but the most sensitive part is at its mouth owing to the ramification of this nerve within it. A minor branch from each one of these two nerves moves one of the organs of the voice, and for this reason the man’s voice went along with his appetite. When I realized this I applied a dressing to warm his neck and he was cured in three days. There was not one who saw this action of mine and had the patience to listen to the theory that led me to his cure who failed to be amazed and to learn that for physicians anatomy is an absolute necessity.

With it he fumigated the mouth of the man who had wormy teeth, as he claimed, and the man could not help closing his eyes. While they were closed he inserted worms into the man’s mouth that he had been keeping ready in boxes, and then he extracted them. At this the fools showered him with their change. Finally he outdid himself and cut open blood vessels that were not near joints. When I saw this, I went right up to the people and said, ‘

                                    when the Christian religion had become established in the days of Galen, he was told that there was a man who had achieved notoriety in a far-flung part of the empire of Octavian Caesar at Jerusalem as a result of curing blind men and lepers and because he raised the dead. ‘He almost has some divine power to do this,’ Galen said, and he enquired if any of his companions was left and received an emphatic ‘Yes!’ So he left Rome intent on Jerusalem and crossed to Sicily, which in those days was called Sikāniyah.

It was summer time. He had a jar fetched containing water. He produced something and tossed it in the jar, left it for an hour, then broke the jar open, and lo and behold the liquid had frozen. From it he made a drug which he drank and used as an enema but to no effect. ‘Do you know why I did this?’, he asked his pupils. ‘No!’ ‘So that you don’t think I am incapable of curing myself! For this is an illness they call “chronic”, which means a disease for which no medicine exists, in other words, death’.

                                    Galen’s father took considerable care over him and spent a great deal of money doing so. He paid tutors handsome salaries to bring them from faraway towns.

                                    From boyhood onward Galen showed a passion for knowledge based on logic, pursuing it with real eagerness, effort, and aptitude. As a result of his eagerness for knowledge, when he left his teacher’s side and was on the way home he would go over what he had taught him so he could reach the same level. The boys who were with him in class kept cursing him: ‘You there, you’ve got to learn to take some time to laugh with us and come out to play!’ Often he did not answer them because he was so engrossed in his studies but sometimes he asked, ‘What motivates you to laugh and play?’ – ‘We like it!’ – ‘Well, there is a reason why I am motivated to renounce such things and prefer learning and that is my loathing of your behaviour and my love of my own!’ People used to marvel at him, saying, ‘In addition to your father’s enormous wealth and magnificent reputation he has been blessed with a son who thirsts for knowledge!’ His father was a geometer who retained an interest in agriculture. His grandfather was the leading carpenter, while his father’s grandfather was a surveyor.

                                    My dear sir, if you would like to assume I am speaking the truth, feel free to do so, for there is absolutely nothing that compels me to lie. On occasions I have been made extremely angry by discovering that many men of the greatest sense and reputation have frequently lied in their writings on scientific topics. As for me, I have only spoken – and never lied – on matters of personal observation and individual experience over a very long period. May God be my witness that I am not lying when I inform you of my father’s wisdom and excellence. He amassed so much knowledge that nothing was beyond his limits – I refer to surveying, geometry, logic, arithmetic, and the science of the stars, which is called

                                <p>When I had reached adolescence and was grown up, my father went away to an estate, for he loved agricultural science, and left me behind. I was busy with my lessons and education. I was altogether superior to my school friends, outstripping them and outdoing them in knowledge. I laboured night and day at my schooling. One day I ate some fruit with my friends and filled my belly with it. It was during the onset of autumn and I became acutely ill and needed a phlebotomy. My father returned to me at that point, entered the city, and came and scolded me, recalling for me the regimen, the guidance, and the foods he had nourished me with when I was young. Then he ordered and exhorted me, saying, ‘Be careful from now on! Look after yourself and steer clear of your young friends’ excessive appetites and their demanding and irresponsible behaviour!’</p>

                                <p>The next year my father wanted to have a plan for me to eat carefully and he made me stick to it. He put me on a diet and kept me to an appropriate regimen with the result that I ate hardly any fruit. It was my nineteenth year and I got through it free of disease and trouble. The following year death claimed him. I again consorted with my friends and companions among those youths and ate fruit and overdid it. I filled my belly up and became ill with the same illness as before, and again needed a phlebotomy. In the next years I was affected by outbreaks of disease, sometimes with remission for a year, until I reached 28. Then I suffered from a grave complaint, for an ulcer arose in the place where the liver joins with the diaphragm (this is the membrane that separates the respiratory and digestive systems). I determined after this not to touch fresh fruit except for a few figs and grapes, and these only when ripe. I avoided excess beyond measure and capacity and ate only a limited quantity of them and did not exceed it. I had an older colleague who agreed with me and supported my decision to keep right away from fruits. What we needed to do was to stay slim and be careful not to suffer indigestion or give into our appetite for food. And together we have remained to this day without pain or sickness over many years. When I noticed this, I focused my attention on my closest friends and intimate companions and obliged them to stay slim and eat a moderate and balanced diet. They have stayed healthy and have had nothing too troublesome to this day. Some of them have enjoyed constant health for 25 years, some for 15 years, some have stayed well for a shorter or longer period depending on whether they listened and stuck to the quantities I set for them and kept away from fresh fruits and other examples of foodstuffs with bad juices.</p>

The chronology does not fit Alexander of Damascus, since

                                    was written at least 20 years earlier; but a reference to his chair could, it is suggested, have been inserted later in confusion. One may wonder if Arab writers actually knew of Aphrodisias, which had changed its name in late antiquity, and found for Alexander a civic identity they could recognize. On the two Alexanders see Goulet &amp; Aouad, ‘Alexandros’, 126–127.

                                    This work (title no. 120 in the list of Galenic titles, using its alternative title) was recently rediscovered in a unique Greek manuscript (see Nutton, ‘Avoiding Distress’; Boudon-Millot, Jouanna, Pietrobelli,
                                    <hi rend="italic">Ne pas se chagriner</hi>
                                    ). The Arabic, translated by Ḥunayn’s nephew Ḥubaysh, is lost apart from quotations. The theme of the work develops from the description of Galen’s composure following the loss of his books and possessions in the great fire that devastated central Rome in early 192, an event he refers to often (e.g.

                            he says that a significant quantity of his books and effects was destroyed by fire in the great imperial storehouses of the city of Rome. Some of the manuscripts that were destroyed had been written by Aristotle, others by Anaxagoras or Andromachus. Galen had corrected their readings following the method of the authorities who had taught him and the scholars who had transmitted them from Plato downwards.

                                    as we have it Galen specifies the loss of autograph copies as well as his own corrected texts of famous books. But it is not clear what αὐτόγραφα means: see Boudon-Millot, Jouanna, Pietrobelli,

                                    Anaxagoras and Andromachus are not mentioned in our Greek but it is unlikely that al-Mubashshir would have introduced these names himself and we should assume they were present in the redaction translated into Arabic.

                            In general there is a vast amount of information about Galen. There are stories useful to people who examine them, and snippets and anecdotes scattered all over his books and throughout the reports passed down to us about him. There are many stories detailing his treatment of the sick and testifying to his ability and skill in the art of medicine. It is not feasible for me now to record all this material here. My intention is to write a monograph setting out all noteworthy material of this sort which I have found throughout his books and in others – if God the Exalted wills it.

                                    One was a decoction of fenugreek, another of roses, and the third unpounded saffron. All the physicians in attendance observed how I employed these washes but none was in a position follow my example here because they did not know the method or the daily dosage for each wash to be administered to suit the condition. The dosage of these washes was indicated by various factors: the intensity and dominance of the pain, the bulge of the protrusion, the quantity of impure matter in the ulcer or increase in its pus. By employing nothing but these washes I attained my aim of reducing the protrusion of the iris where there was swelling, of stilling the pain, of cleansing the ulcer at when it contained much impure material, of encouraging the tissue to grow when the ulcer was still deep, and of causing it to heal over when it was full.

                                <p>Let me give you an example relating to a group of leading Roman physicians. During my first visit there I joined them when they were attending a young man who was suffering from a fever. They were considering whether to bleed him and this led to an argument. When the discussion became protracted, I said to them, ‘Arguing is beside the point, for nature will soon burst a vessel and cause the excess blood in this young man’s body to be purged through the nostrils.’ They did not have to wait long before they saw this with their own eyes. They were stunned instantly and dumbfounded and the event caused them to hate me with all their hearts and to label me a ‘miracle teller’.</p>

                                    another occasion I attended a patient who presented very clear signs indicating an eventual nosebleed. I was not content with merely forewarning of this but stated that it would come from the right-hand side. The physicians who were there rebuked me and said, ‘We don’t believe we need
                                    <hi rend="italic">you</hi>
                                    to show us!’ I replied, ‘Let me point out to you in addition that in a moment you will be thrown into a great state of confusion and serious alarm when the nosebleed happens because it will be difficult to stop. I just don’t see his nature being strong enough to manage the sheer quantity of the evacuation needed and to bring the process to an end.’ Things turned out as I had described. Those physicians were unable to stop the blood because they did not know the movement of blood had started. I on the other hand checked the flow very easily, with the result that they named me a ‘miracle worker’.

                                    and catarrhs. These were taken while the patient was trying to get to sleep because they induced a deep feeling of drowsiness. The effect was useful against insomnia and sleeplessness and he slept heavily all night long. The cough was relieved and the catarrh dispersed. But he began to complain of a heaviness in his respiratory organs and was afflicted with a severe constriction in his chest and in his breathing. At this point the physicians saw no alternative but to get him to drink something that would help him cough up what was in his lungs. After he took it, he brought up a great quantity of viscous fluid. During the following night his cough returned keeping him awake and he began to feel a soft substance slipping down from his head into his throat and windpipe. During the following night they had no choice but to get him to take the sleeping potion, and the catarrh, cough, and sleeplessness consequently disappeared. However, his breathing became much more constricted and his condition deteriorated during the night after this. They had no choice but to make him drink medicine to thin and disperse the fluid in his lungs. He drank it and his lungs were cleared. But he was affected by coughing and severe asthma

                                    When I realized the physicians had no idea what they were doing and no plan, that evening I had him take a medicine that did not aggravate his cough or catarrh. This induced a sound sleep and made it easy for him to bring up the fluid in his lungs. By proceeding in this manner I cured the patient of two illnesses at the same time in just a few days despite the fact that they appear to be contradictory to one another. It goes to show for anyone interested that physicians who maintain the impossibility of using a drug to cure two diseases are quite mistaken. I pioneered the application of such medicines and also the application of medicines for treating ulcers that occur in the lungs as a result of catarrh descending from the head, not to mention many other drugs. I shall set out the method of applying them in a book on the composition of drugs.

                                <p>Sorrow is about what has gone, worry is about something to come. Watch out for it! For sorrow brings life to an end. Don’t you see that a living being in sorrow will inevitably go to ruin?</p>

                                <p>Writing about the form of the heart Galen observed,</p>
                                <p>There are two cavities in the heart, right and left. More blood is found in the right hand cavity than in the left hand one. They contain two vessels which lead to the brain. If something occurs in the heart that disagrees with its temperament, it will contract. As a result of the heart’s contraction, the two blood vessels contract and consequently the face is convulsed and the body suffers pain. When something that agrees with its temperament occurs, the vessels expand on account of the heart’s own expansion.</p>

                                <p>
                                    In the heart is a small vessel like a tube that spreads out over its sac-like surface and reaches to its deepest core (
                                    <hi rend="italic">shaghāf al-qalb wa-suwaydāʾihi</hi>
                                    ). When sorrow affects the heart this small blood vessel contracts and blood trickles out of it into the core of the heart as well as its surface. Simultaneously blood squirts from the two vessels and envelops the heart so that the heart is put under pressure to such an extent that pressure is felt in heart, mind, soul and body, in much the same way as alcoholic vapours envelop the brain and lead to intoxication.

                                <p>There is another story:</p>
                                <p>Galen wanted to put this to the test so he took an animal that possessed sensation and caused it pain for several days. When he had killed it, he found the heart was shrivelled and pinched and that most of it had withered away. He concluded from this that when times of sorrow come upon the heart and worries oppress it, it shrivels and becomes emaciated. Thenceforward he warned people of the effects of sorrow and worry.</p>

                                <p>Passionate love is an action of the soul, and the soul lies concealed within the brain, the heart, and the liver. In the brain there are three faculties: imagination at the front of the head, reasoning in the middle, and memory at the back. No-one fully deserves the name of lover unless his imagination, reasoning, memory, heart and liver are besotted with his beloved whenever they are apart so that he refuses food and drink because his liver is preoccupied and cannot sleep because his brain is busy with imagining, remembering and thinking about him, and thus each abode of his soul is distracted. But if he is not absorbed at the times they are apart, he is no lover. Indeed, when he meets him, these abodes are unoccupied.</p>

                                I have seen many kings pay a higher price for slaves who were trained in various disciplines and crafts as well as for mounts that were first-class among their kind, but who neglected to educate themselves. Indeed, if a slave like him were presented for sale to one of these kings, the king would refuse to buy him or accept him. The most regrettable thing I can think of is that a man who is owned is worth a vast sum while no-one can be found to take his owner for free!

                                Physicians used to accord themselves the status of rulers and the status of subjects to their patients, who would not oppose what was decided for them. In those times medicine was much more effective. But now that things have changed in our time, so that the sick take the place of ruler and the physician that of subject, and physicians serve the pleasure of the sick and abandon the service of their bodies, physicians are of little benefit.

                                In the past men used to meet and drink and argue with one another about the effects of drinks upon temperaments and of music upon the faculty of passion and about the types of things that countered each of them. But when they meet today they compete about who has the largest cup to drink from.

                                If someone is accustomed from boyhood to a balanced and regular way of life, his appetites will be moderate. But if he has been accustomed neither to restrain his desires nor to refrain from anything you suggest to him, he will continue to be greedy. For all things become powerful and strong through frequent practice of the actions that are associated with them, while everything functions less well as a result of disuse.

                            <item>In the same manner he said: Let me present you with an allegory of the four humours. Yellow bile, which is in fact red bile, is like a woman who has a sharp tongue but is good and pious. She causes harm by her tirades and quick temper but soon calms down without disaster. Blood is like a rabid dog. When he enters your house, catch him and put him out or kill him. Phlegm, when it moves in the body, is like a king entering your house. Though you fear his villainy and tyrannical behaviour, you cannot cross him or harm him but have to remain friendly when you usher him out. Black bile in the body is like a spiteful man whose motives are unsuspected but then pounces with a sudden attack. Then there is nothing odious he will leave undone, and he will not calm down without a great deal of trouble.</item>

Greek proper names have been standardized in the Arabic text (and hence in the English translation) since it is often difficult to be sure what

                                    depends closely on Ḥunayn’s own account of his and others’ translations of Galen in his famous

                                    (‘Letter’), but with just a few exceptions does not make it clear that he is very often borrowing verbatim for entire entries. The differences between
                                    <hi rend="smallcaps">IAU</hi>
                                    ’s quotations and Bergsträsser’s 1925 edition of the Letter are minor but occasionally significant. From a comparison of the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Risālah</hi>
                                    ’s two extant recensions ‘A’ and ‘B’ (see below), it is clear that
                                    <hi rend="smallcaps">IAU</hi>
                                    follows the later ‘A’ version but his text quite often matches ‘B’ against ‘A’ (see esp. title 110 where ‘Ḥunayn says’ marks the use of the earlier recension). He may have kept both versions to hand or more likely possessed a copy of ‘A’ that had been ‘contaminated’ with ‘B’ perhaps to improve what was a fundamental work of reference, a common enough event in the making of manuscripts (cf. Rosenthal,
                                    <hi rend="italic">Technique and Approach</hi>
                                    ).

                                    naturally incorporates his own small alterations and adds or omits material and may name titles differently from Ḥunayn’s (which in any case vary between the ‘A’ and ‘B’ recensions of the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Risālah</hi>
                                    ), reflecting how he himself happened to be acquainted with a particular work. In the Arabic text here differences with Ḥunayn (‘A’ unless specified) are noted for the parts of each entry where dependency is clear and for the most part exclude book titles. No attempt has been made to undertake a detailed comparison.

                                Since no-one is in a position to treat diseases without having identified them, before he turns to treatment Galen introduces the signs by which they are recognized. In section one he describes signs of fevers and how to treat them. He does not mention all of them but restricts himself to those that occur commonly. This section contains two divisions. In the first he describes fevers which lack unusual symptoms. In the second he takes fevers that do present these. In section two he sets out the signs of tumours and their treatments.

If he entitles a book “for beginners”, he indicates that it contains a complete course on this subject but that the course is in fact “for beginners”.’ His intention is that a beginner in medicine should prioritize the study of anatomy

He wrote it “to beginners” and his aim was to describe the number of paired nerves that derive from the brain and the spinal cord, which nerves are involved, and how and from where they each divide off, and what their function is.

                                This book consists of a single section as far as Galen is concerned, and in it he describes the topic of blood vessels with and without a pulse. He wrote it “for beginners” and entitled it “To Antisthenes” (

                                ). The Alexandrians divided it into two sections, one on the veins and one on the arteries. Galen’s aim was to describe the number of veins that derive from the liver, which veins are involved, how they are organized, and from where they each divide off, the number of arteries that derive from the heart, which arteries are involved, how they are organized, and from where they each divide off.

                                It consists of a single section. Galen’s aim is to show that all solids subject to generation and corruption – i.e. the bodies of animals and plants as well as the solids that are generated in the earth – are constructed from the four elements of fire, air, water, earth. These are the primary elements and are peripheral to the human body. But the secondary, immediate elements that are the basis of the human body and all other creatures that have blood are the four humours, blood, phlegm, and the two types of bile.

                                It is in six sections. His aim is to describe the signs that allow one to deduce the state of the internal parts when they are diseased and on this basis to specify which disease is present. In the first section and in part of the second he outlines the general system for classifying diseases and their locations. In section three he exposes the erroneous methods used by Archigenes in his attempt to attain this objective.

He describes the signs that allow one to decide how to establish a detailed classification of a disease in each case where a body part is ill.

In section three he outlines the reasons why days differ in their influence in the way they do.

In the first section he describes the muscles and ligaments of the arms, in the second the muscles and ligaments of the legs, and in the third covers the nerves and vessels of the arms and legs. In four he deals with the muscles which control movements of the cheeks and lips and those which move the lower jaw up to the head and down to the neck and shoulder blades. In five he treats muscles of the chest, abdomen, loins, and spine. In section six he considers the organs of nourishment, i.e. stomach, guts, liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder, and so on. In section seven and eight he describes the anatomy of the respiratory organs – in seven he shows us what is revealed by dissecting the heart, lungs, and arteries either after the death of a living thing or during its lifetime, while in eight he discusses the anatomy of the whole chest. He devotes the entirety of section nine to the anatomy of the brain and spinal cord. In ten he covers the anatomy of the eyes, tongue, oesophagus and the parts of the body connected to them. In eleven he discusses the larynx and the bone that resembles the Greek equivalent of

                                Indeed it was a fellow pupil who asked him for it. In the first two sections and the beginning of the third he sets out what he learnt from his teacher Pelops on this topic. In the remainder of the third section he outlines his own discoveries.

                                He composed this book in two sections for Boethus on his first trip to Rome. His aim in both is to explain which organs give rise to breathing that is automatic and which breathing that is forced.

                                It is in two sections. His aim is to show the nature of the movement of the muscles, its workings, and the origin of these different movements in muscle even though their movement is unitary. He also investigates whether breath is voluntary or the result of natural movements and engages in a wide-ranging and sophisticated enquiry on the topic.

He shows that the laxative effects of drugs and what they purge does not come about because any of these drugs change matter they encounter in the body into its own nature, thereby causing it to be expelled and pass out. Rather each of them attracts to itself a humour that is compatible and consistent with itself.

                                It is in ten sections. His aim is to show that Plato is consistent with Hippocrates in the majority of his views since he borrows most of them from him, and that where Aristotle diverges from them, he is wrong. He explains everything one needs to know about the soul as the governing faculty responsible for thought, imagination, and memory, and of the three roots that are the sources of the faculties responsible for governing the body.

He takes sections six and seven on the subject of the organs used in breathing, and in eight and nine he focusses on the inside of the head. In ten he treats the eyes and in eleven the other features of the face. In section twelve he discusses the parts of the body that are associated with the head and neck. In thirteen he turns to the areas near to the spine and shoulder blades. In the two following sections he describes the Creator’s wisdom at work in the parts of the body responsible for reproduction. Then in section sixteen he considers organs common to the whole body such as arteries, veins and nerves. In seventeen he describes the disposition and proportions of all parts of the body and demonstrates the usefulness of the entire book.

                                He arranged this book in eleven sections. In the first two of these he exposes the mistakes people have made by using poor methods to evaluate the properties of drugs. After this, in section three he provides a solid basis for the whole discipline of evaluating the primary properties of drugs. Section four clarifies secondary properties such as tastes or smells and informs us how to deduce from these the primary properties of drugs. In section five he describes the tertiary properties of drugs, i.e. the effects of warming, cooling, drying, or moistening that are produced by them in the body. In the three sections that follow he describes the property of each of the drugs that are pieces of plants. Next in section nine he examines the properties of drugs that are parts of the earth, i.e. types of soil, clay, stone, or minerals. In section ten he looks at drugs that come from materials produced in the bodies of living creatures, and in eleven describes the properties of drugs that come from materials generated in the sea or salt water.

                                        Using a Stoicizing vocabulary Galen split the Aristotelian idea of an efficient cause into three. The ‘cohesive cause’ (συνεκτικὸν αἴτιον νοσήματος) was the state in which a body part malfunctioned and produced e.g. excess. It worked with an ‘antecedent’ cause (
                                        <hi rend="italic">causa antecedens</hi>
                                        ), which was the patient’s predisposition to a particular weakness, and an ‘initial’ cause (
                                        <hi rend="italic">causa procatarctica</hi>
                                        ), which was an external trigger such as heat or injury, to bring about a disease.

                                He wrote the book in three sections. His aim is to describe the types and causes of difficult breathing and what they signify. In the first section he describes types and causes of breathing, in the second types of difficult breathing and what each means, and in the third section he cites passages of Hippocrates that confirm the validity of his argument.

In the second section he attacks his followers at Rome for the same notion. In the third he gives his own views about treatment by means of phlebotomy.

                                we came across a reference to a threefold division of the book. Galen notes that the first and third portions of it are spurious and not by Hippocrates but that the second portion is genuine. It was on this that Gessius of Alexandria wrote a commentary.

                                We have in fact found two commentaries on all three books together. One of these is in Syriac and bears the inscription that it is by Galen and in the translation of Sergius.

As for me, I had no desire to translate any of it without the prospect of being able to read the entire thing both because of its damaged and defective condition and because my soul longed to discover a complete version. But later I translated what I had into Syriac. This comprised a small portion of the second section, most of the third, and approximately half of the fourth from the beginning together with the ninth except for part of the beginning, which had fallen out. I came across all the other sections bar the fifteenth, which was defective at the end. ʿĪsā ibn Yaḥyā

He starts his quotation with the second preface on books that were falsely ascribed to Galen (the first part of the work deals with genuine titles that had not been mentioned in

                            ‘We have also come across a number of books with Galen’s name in the title but not by him. Rather, some of them are snippets of Galenic phrases arranged by other people to make books. In other cases they are by authors prior to Galen and later on someone put Galen’s name in the title. He did this either out of a desire to multiply the number of Galenic books in his possession no-one else owned or because of a lack of sense that it is a constant attribute of fools such that when they come across a book with a number of sections to it and find the first of these begins with a certain person’s name, they assume all the other sections are by the same person. This is why we find many sections in books by Rufus that have Galen’s name in the title – for example, his treatise

                            This is the sum total of Galen’s books, authentic or attributed, that I have been able to list following the entries in Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq’s book on his discoveries or translations into Arabic. He made this when he was 48 years old. Since he lived till 70, he must have come across many additional works of Galen’s that were translated into Arabic, just as we have found many of Galen’s books and others ascribed to him in translations by Ḥunayn or other people and of which there is absolutely no record in his above cited work.

                                ‘In this book Galen intended to describe all the secret and special remedies he had assembled over his lifetime and had successfully tried out on many occasions but had concealed and kept back from most people. He gave instruction in them to only a select number of practitioners of the art who possessed the right qualities and the soundest judgment. Someone other than myself made a version of it but made a mess by adding material that was not present and omitting things he did not understand how to translate. I applied myself to it so far as opportunity and ability allowed, compared it with my own considerable experience, and made an Arabic version for Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad ibn Mūsā’.

                            In conclusion I would note that Galen certainly wrote many other books that translators did not find or that were lost in the course of time, in particular those mentioned in the second section of Galen’s catalogue of his works called the

                            Among the famous physicians following Galen’s death or near to him were the Alexandrians Stephanus, Nicolaus, Gessius, and Marinus; these four are among the commentators on Galen’s books, and summarized and abridged them and shortened what he said;

                                    The four are associated in the Arabic tradition with the composition of the Summaria Alexandrinorum, the summaries (or rather excerpts with comments and notes) of the sixteen books of Galen that formed the Alexandrian curriculum, some of them being an amalgamation of several separate treatises (cf. 5.137 titles 8, 14, 16). Only Gessius (Γέσιος or Γέσσιος), a late 5th c. physician and philosopher of great fame and wealth (e.g. Suda γ 207), is known with certainty (Watts, ‘The Enduring Legacy’); but there are works attributed to Palladius and Stephanus (on whom see Wolska-Conus, ‘Stéphanos’). Nicolaus is
