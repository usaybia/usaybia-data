                            to have them all brought before him. When they were assembled, al-Manṣūr confronted them and demanded, ‘Does any one of you know of a competent physician in any city anywhere?’ ‘Yes,’ they replied, ‘at the present time, there is no one who is comparable to Jūrjis, the head physician at Gondēshāpūr.

                                    Gondēshāpūr (Jundaysābūr) was an ancient city (now ruins) to the southeast of Dizfūl in what is now southwest Iran that was reputed to be a centre of medical learning, complete with a hospital and an academy. For the reasons why much of that reputation is to be regarded as mythical, see Pormann and Savage-Smith,

                            He is a knowledgeable physician and has written important works on the art of medicine.’ Upon hearing this, al-Manṣūr at once dispatched an emissary to bring Jūrjis to Baghdad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the emissary reached Gondēshāpūr, he ordered the governor of the place to have Jūrjis brought to him. When he appeared, the emissary informed him that they were to travel together to Baghdad at once. ‘I have some matters to attend to here first,’ said Jūrjis, ‘you will have to wait a few days until I am free to go with you.’ ‘If you will come with me tomorrow morning of your own volition, well and good,’ said the emissary, ‘otherwise, I am taking you with me, like it or not.’ Jūrjis refused, whereupon the emissary had him seized and put under arrest. The leading men of the town, including the Metropolitan, then went in a body to see him and urged him to comply, and in the end he agreed, first designating his son Bukhtīshūʿ to be in charge of the hospital and all matters pertaining to it and selecting two of his pupils, Ibrāhīm and Sarjis (Sergius),

                            to accompany him to Baghdad. At this, Bukhtīshūʿ begged him to select another pupil, ʿĪsā ibn Shahlā, to take with him instead. ‘Don’t leave him here,’ he said, ‘for he is a serious annoyance to the patients

                            of the hospital.’ Accordingly, Jūrjis left Sarjis behind and took ‘Īsā along with him instead, and they all set out for Baghdad.
                        </p>
                        <p>As Jūrjis was taking leave of his son Bukhtīshūʿ, the young man said to him, ‘Why are you not taking me with you?’ Jūrjis replied, ‘There is no hurry, my boy. You are going to serve kings and achieve great things.’</p>
                        <p>As soon as the party reached the caliph’s court, al-Manṣūr ordered Jūrjis brought before him. Upon entering, he greeted the caliph in Persian and in Arabic. Al-Manṣūr was greatly impressed at his visitor’s distinguished demeanour and cultivated speech, and bade him be seated. He then asked the physician about various matters, Jūrjis responding with composure. Finally al-Manṣūr said, ‘It seems to me that in you I have found the man I have been looking for,’ and he proceeded to describe his illness and its initial symptoms. ‘I shall treat you in a way you will like,’ replied Jūrjis, whereupon the caliph ordered the servants to bring a robe of honour for him and said to al-Rabīʿ, ‘Have one of our best suites of apartments placed at his disposal, and see to it that he is treated as an honoured guest.’</p>
                        <p>
                            The next morning, Jūrjis went to see al-Manṣūr. He felt his pulse, examined a phial of his urine, and persuaded him that a lighter diet would be beneficial. With such conservative treatment, the caliph was soon his old self again. Delighted at this outcome, he ordered that the physician’s every wish should be granted. A few days later, however, al-Manṣūr said to al-Rabīʿ, ‘That man looks discontented to me. You haven’t been depriving him of something that he usually drinks, have you?’ ‘Well,’ said the chamberlain, ‘we’re not allowing him to bring wine into the palace.’ At this, the caliph cursed him roundly and said, ‘You yourself shall go and obtain for him as much wine as he wants.’ So al-Rabīʿ went out to Quṭrabbul

                        <p>After Jūrjis had been in Baghdad for two years, al-Manṣūr said to him, ‘Send someone to Gondēshāpūr to bring your son here, for I have heard that he is as skilled in the art of medicine as you are yourself.’ ‘He is needed there in Gondēshāpūr,’ objected Jūrjis. ‘If he were to leave, the hospital would go to rack and ruin, and the people of the town would have no one to consult when they fell ill. But I have some of my pupils here with me, young men whom I have taught myself and whom I have trained in the art of medicine until they are as skilled as I am myself.’ The caliph ordered him to bring them to him the following morning so that he might put them to the test. The next day, accordingly, Jūrjis brought ʿĪsā ibn Shahlā with him to see al-Manṣūr. The caliph questioned the young man on various matters, and found him to be quick-witted and proficient in his understanding of the art of medicine. ‘Your description was quite accurate,’ said al-Manṣūr to Jūrjis, ‘you have taught him well.’</p>

                            In the year 151/768, Jūrjis went to see the caliph on Christmas Day. ‘What shall I eat today?’ enquired al-Manṣūr. ‘Whatever the Commander of the Faithful chooses,’ replied Jūrjis, and made as though to take his leave, but when he had reached the door, the caliph called him back. ‘Who are your servants here?’ he asked. ‘My pupils,’ answered Jūrjis. ‘I have heard that you have no wife,’ said al-Manṣūr. ‘I do have a wife,’ Jūrjis said, ‘but she is old and frail, and cannot leave home to be with me here,’ and he left the caliph’s presence and went to the church. The caliph then ordered his eunuch

                            Sālim to select three attractive Roman slave-girls and to deliver them to Jūrjis, along with the sum of three thousand dinars.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sālim did as he had been ordered to do, and when Jūrjis returned home, his pupil ʿĪsā ibn Shahlā informed him what had happened and showed him the slave-girls. Jūrjis was not pleased. ‘Pupil of Satan!’ he said to ʿĪsā. ‘Why did you let them into my house? Go at once and take them back to their owner.’ Mounting his mule, he rode with ʿĪsā and the slave-girls to the caliph’s palace and handed the girls over to the eunuch. When al-Manṣūr heard of the matter, he sent for Jūrjis and asked him why he had returned the slave-girls. ‘Such persons cannot stay in the same house with me,’ answered Jūrjis, ‘because we Christians marry one woman only, and as long as she lives, we take no other wife.’ Al-Manṣūr was filled with admiration, and immediately gave orders that Jūrjis should be allowed admittance to the quarters of his wives and concubines and that he should serve as their physician. This incident enhanced his prestige even further in the caliph’s eyes.</p>
                        <p>Pethion’s account goes on: In the year 152/769, Jūrjis fell gravely ill. The caliph sent servants daily to obtain news of him, and when his condition worsened, al-Manṣūr ordered him carried in a litter to the public reception of the palace. There the caliph walked out to greet him and ask how he was. ‘O Commander of the Faithful, may God prolong your life,’ cried Jūrjis, his tears flowing copiously, ‘if you would but permit me to return to my native land to see my wife and children and, if I die, to be buried there with my ancestors.’ ‘Fear God and accept Islam, Jūrjis,’ said the caliph; ‘for I can guarantee that you will see Paradise.’ ‘No,’ replied Jūrjis, ‘I shall die in the religion of my ancestors. I want to be with them wherever they are, be that Paradise or Hell.’ The caliph laughed at this. ‘I have been in the best of health ever since I set eyes on you,’ he said. ‘I used to fall ill all the time, but no longer.’ ‘Suppose I leave ʿĪsā ibn Shahlā here with you,’ said Jūrjis, ‘for I have trained him.’ At this, the caliph ordered that Jūrjis should be given 10,000 dinars and allowed to return to his native land, with a servant to accompany him. ‘If he should die on the way,’ said al-Mansūr to the servant, ‘have his body carried to his home, so that he can be buried there as he desires to be.’ In the event, however, Jūrjis was still alive when they reached Gondēshāpūr.</p>
                        <p>
                            ʿĪsā ibn Shahlā thus took Jūrjis’ place as physician to al-Manṣūr, but he abused his position to plunder metropolitans and bishops, taking their property for himself. However, he overreached when he wrote to the Metropolitan of Niṣībīn
                            <note n="11" type="footnote">

                            demanding various church furnishings that were of substantial value, and uttering dire threats in case the Metropolitan should be slow about complying. ‘Are you not aware,’ he said in the letter, ‘of the power I have over the caliph? I can make him fall ill if I wish, and if I wish I can cure him.’ The Metropolitan pondered the contents of the letter, racking his brains for some means of escaping his tormentor. Finally he went to al-Rabīʿ, explained the situation to him and read him ʿĪsā’s letter. The chamberlain, in his turn, went to al-Manṣūr and informed him of what had been going on. The caliph immediately ordered that ʿĪsā ibn Shahlā should be dismissed and all his ill-gotten gains confiscated.
                        </p>
                        <p>Al-Manṣūr then ordered al-Rabīʿ to enquire for Jūrjis. ‘If he is alive,’ he said, ‘send someone to bring him here, and if he has died, have his son brought instead,’ Accordingly, the chamberlain sent a letter of enquiry to the governor of Gondēshāpūr. It so happened, however, that Jūrjis had recently fallen from the roof of his house and was too weak to travel. When the governor approached him about the matter, he answered, ‘Please inform the caliph that I shall send him a competent physician who will serve him until such time as I am well again and can go myself.’</p>
                        <p>He then sent for one of his pupils, named Ibrāhīm, and the governor sent him off to al-Rabīʿ, with a letter explaining the matter of Jūrjis’ state of health. When he arrived in Baghdad, al-Rabīʿ presented him to the caliph, who spoke to him about various matters. Ibrāhīm proved to be quick-witted and able to answer al-Manṣūr’s questions readily, with the result that the caliph granted him advancement, treated him with respect, bestowed a robe of honour upon him, paid him lavishly, and retained him for his exclusive service. Ibrāhīm continued as al-Manṣūr’s personal physician until the caliph’s death.</p>

                            The caliph immediately ordered the physician brought to him. ‘As for that lot,’ he added, ‘off with their heads.’ Al-Rabīʿ did not have the latter order carried out, knowing as he did that the caliph was not fully

                            because of his illness, and also aware that his own situation was secure. He did send to Ṣarṣar for the physician ʿAbdīshūʿ, and when he arrived, took him to see Mūsā. ‘Have you seen my phial of urine?’ the caliph asked him. He replied, ‘I have, O Commander of the Faithful, and I am here to prepare a remedy for you. Nine hours from now you will be well and rid of your illness.’ After leaving the caliph’s presence, he said to the three physicians, ‘Do not be concerned. You shall all return to your homes later today.’ The caliph had given ʿAbdīshūʿ ten thousand dinars to enable him to purchase the necessary medicines, but the physician had the money carried to his own home instead. He did have some medicinal materials brought to the palace, however. Calling the physicians together in a room not far from where the caliph lay, he said to them, ‘Pound this stuff vigorously so that he can hear you; that will keep him easy in mind. By the end of the day, there will be nothing to keep you here any longer.’ Every hour, the caliph would call him in and enquire about the remedy, and he would answer, ‘It is almost ready, you can hear my servants pounding the ingredients,’ whereupon the caliph would say no more. After nine hours the caliph died, and the physicians were allowed to go home. This incident took place in the year 170/786.

                            ‘These physicians are no good at all.’ ‘O Commander of the Faithful,’ the vizier replied, ‘Abū Quraysh served both your parents as physician.’ ‘I show him respect because of his long and faithful service,’ said the caliph, ‘but he doesn’t know much about medicine. I want you to find me someone who does.’ ‘When your brother Mūsā fell ill,’ said Yaḥyā, ‘your father sent to Gondēshāpūr for a man by the name of Bukhtīshūʿ.’ ‘And then allowed him to leave afterward?’ said the caliph, ‘How so?’ ‘When the caliph saw that ʿĪsā Abū Quraysh and your mother were hostile to him, he gave him permission to return to his own country,’ explained the vizier. ‘Have the postal couriers dispatched to bring him here,’ said the caliph, ‘if he is still among the living.’

                            It was not long before the elder Bukhtīshūʿ, Bukhtīshūʿ ibn Jūrjis, reached the court. Upon being presented to Hārūn al-Rashīd, he greeted him in both Arabic and Persian. The caliph laughed. ‘You know about dialectics,’ he said to Yaḥyā, ‘come, discuss some abstruse matters with him, I should like to hear how he argues.’ ‘No, we should call in the physicians instead,’ said the vizier, so the four of them – Abū Quraysh ʿĪsā, ‘Abd Allāh al-Ṭayfūrī, Dāwūd ibn Sarābiyūn and Serjis

No sooner had Bukhtīshūʿ set eyes on it than he exclaimed, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, this is no human urine.’ ‘Wrong!’ cried Abū Quraysh, ‘this is urine from one of the ladies of the harem.’ ‘O venerable shaykh,’ said Bukhtīshūʿ, ‘as I stand here, I declare this is no urine ever excreted by any human being. If the matter is as you say, it would appear that the lady in question has been turned into an animal.’ ‘What makes you so sure that it is not human urine?’ asked the caliph. ‘Its consistency, colour and odour are not those of human urine,’ replied Bukhtīshūʿ. ‘Who taught you your art?’ enquired Hārūn. ‘My father, Jūrjis,’ said the physician. ‘It is true, his father’s name was Jūrjis,’ chorused the others, ‘and he had no peer in his time; the caliph Abū Jaʿfar al-Manṣūr had the utmost respect for him.’ The caliph then turned to Bukhtīshūʿ and asked him, ‘What sort of diet would you recommend for the patient who produced this urine?’ ‘Some of your best barley,’ said the physician. This sally caused al-Rashīd to roar with laughter. He then ordered that Bukhtīshūʿ should be given a fine, costly robe of honour and a well-filled purse. ‘Bukhtīshūʿ,’ he said, ‘shall henceforth be chief among my physicians; the others shall be under his orders and shall obey him in all matters.’

                            to be responsible for serving and caring for him. One day Jaʿfar said to him, ‘I should like you to select a competent physician for me, one worthy of my respect and recompense.’ ‘My son Jibrīl is more competent than I am myself.’ replied Bukhtīshūʿ, ‘There is no other physician like him.’ ‘Bring him to me,’ said Jaʿfar. Once Jibrīl had taken charge of the case, he had Jaʿfar on his feet again within three days. As a result, Jaʿfar loved him like a second self, and could not bear to be parted from him for so much as an hour; they ate and drank together.

                        <p>About that time, one of Hārūn al-Rashīd’s concubines, having extended one arm, found herself unaccountably unable to lower it again. The physicians treated her with embrocations and oils, but to no avail. ‘This girl is no better,’ said al-Rashīd to Jaʿfar. ‘I know of a highly competent doctor.’ said Jaʿfar, ‘He is Bukhtīshūʿ’s son. Suppose we call him in and consult him about the case; he may know of some way of treating her.’ Accordingly, Jaʿfar had him summoned, and when he arrived, Hārūn al-Rashīd asked him his name. ‘Jibrīl,’ he replied. ‘What do you know about medicine?’ asked the caliph. ‘I can cool what is unnaturally hot, warm what is unnaturally cold, moisten what is unnaturally dry and dry what is unnaturally moist,’ said the physician. The caliph laughed. ‘Well, that’s what the art of medicine is all about, isn’t it?’ he said, and then he explained the strange case of the slave-girl. ‘O Commander of the Faithful,’ said Jibrīl, ‘if you won’t be angry with me, I do have an idea for a way of treating her.’ ‘What is it?’ asked Hārūn al-Rashīd. ‘Will you bring her out here for all to see,’ said Jibrīl, ‘so that I can do what I want to do, and I beseech you, give me time, without becoming angry at once.’</p>
                        <p>Hārūn al-Rashīd had the girl brought out, and as soon as Jibrīl saw her he ran toward her, stooped, and seized the hem of her robe, as though intending to lift it revealingly. The girl, in her alarm for her modesty, found that her limbs functioned after all: she lowered her arms, grasped the cloth with both hands, and held it down. ‘There, O Commander of the Faithful,’ said Jibrīl, ‘she is cured,’ ‘Hold both your arms out, the left and the right,’ said Hārūn al-Rashīd to the girl, and she did so, much to the amazement of all the company, including the caliph, who awarded Jibrīl 500,000 dirhams then and there. This feat enhanced his standing in al-Rashīd’s eyes even further, and he was made chief of all the court physicians.</p>
                        <p>Jibrīl was asked about the cause of the girl’s illness. ‘During coitus,’ he explained, ‘a thin humour flooded this girl’s limbs, owing to the movement and the diffusion of heat. When the movement of sexual intercourse ceased suddenly, the remnant of that humour congealed inside all her nerves, and there was nothing that could release it but further movement. My idea was to cause its heat to diffuse and thus release that remnant of humour.’</p>

                                <p>Jibrīl went from strength to strength, to such an extent that Hārūn al-Rashīd got into the habit of saying to his companions, ‘If anyone who wants a favour from me, speak to Jibrīl about it; I do anything he asks me to do, and grant him whatever he requests.’ Even military commanders used to come to Jibrīl when they needed anything. His situation was unassailable, for Hārūn al-Rashīd never had a day’s illness for fifteen years after Jibrīl had entered his service, and the caliph attributed his continued good health to his physician.</p>

                                    Hārūn al-Rashīd was stricken by the illness that resulted in his death. As his condition worsened, he asked Jibrīl why he did not cure him. ‘I have always warned you against harmful food and drink and urged you to have less commerce with women,’ replied Jibrīl, ‘but you do not listen to me. Now I have asked you to return home, for your native country is better suited to your temperament, but you have refused. This is a serious illness, and I only hope God will restore you to health.’ At this, the caliph had Jibrīl imprisoned.

Meanwhile, the bishop was treating Hārūn al-Rashīd. As the caliph’s condition deteriorated, the rascally bishop would say to him, ‘You will soon be restored to health,’ adding, ‘this illness is all the result of the mistakes made by Jibrīl.’ The caliph then ordered Jibrīl put to death, but al-Faḍl ibn al-Rabīʿ would not have that order carried out, for by this time he saw that there was no hope for Hārūn al-Rashīd, and accordingly protected the physician. The caliph died a few days later.

He surreptitiously rewarded the physician generously, and wrote to al-Maʾmūn explaining what had happened and how he had regained his health thanks to Jibrīl’s ministrations. What, he asked, should be done about him? Al-Maʾmūn wrote back that Jibrīl should be pardoned.</p>

                                    When al-Maʾmūn entered Baghdad in the year 205/820–821, he ordered Jibrīl to stay at home and not serve at the palace. He sent for a son-in-law of Jibrīl’s named Mīkhāʾīl, who was a medical practitioner, appointed him in Jibrīl’s place and honoured him greatly in order to spite Jibrīl. But then, in the year 210/825–826, the caliph fell seriously ill. He was treated by all the most illustrious physicians, but they were unable to help him. ‘Their potions are only making me worse,’ he said to Mīkhāʾīl. ‘Summon all the physicians and consult them concerning my case.’ At this, the caliph’s brother, Abū ʿĪsā,

Al-Maʾmūn’s condition continued to deteriorate, to the point where he was too weak to take his medicines, and then he was again reminded of Jibrīl, and this time agreed that he should be summoned. When he arrived, he altered the whole management of the case, with the result that the caliph had rallied by the very next day. After three days he was definitely on the mend, much to his satisfaction, and a few days later he had fully recovered. Jibrīl told him that he might eat and drink, and he did.

Would it not be appropriate to honour him?’ Al-Maʾmūn thereupon ordered that Jibrīl should receive a million dirhams and 6,000 ass-loads (1,000

When the caliph spoke to him, he would address him familiarly as ‘Abū ʿĪsā Jibrīl’, and he honoured him even more than his father had done. So highly was Jibrīl regarded that anyone who had been appointed to an administrative post would meet with him and pay his respects before going out to take up his new duties. The caliph treated him as though he had been his father, while his former personal physician, Jibrīl’s son-in-law Mīkhāʾīl, fell into obscurity and disregard.

                                    I called on Jibrīl at his home on the esplanade one day in July, and found him at a table with a tray of good-sized squabs, roasted and dressed with peppers, upon it. He was eating these squabs, and invited me to join him, but I declined. ‘How can I eat such food at this time of year, being only a young man, as I am?’ I said. Jibrīl then asked me, ‘What does the expression “dietary regime” mean, according to you?’ ‘Avoidance of injurious kinds of food,’ I replied. ‘No,’ he said, ‘that is not what it means,’ and then he added, ‘I do not know of anyone, whether of great or humble station, who can abstain from any particular food throughout his life, unless he dislikes it, with no inclination toward it in his soul. As a rule, a person may refrain from eating something for a while, but then is compelled to do so, perhaps because for some reason there is nothing else to be had, or to help an invalid who is staying in his house, or at the invitation of a friend, or because of a sudden craving for it. When he eats that food, after not having eaten it for a long time, his nature does not accept it and recoils from it, and the result is a series of abdominal upsets, which may even cause his death. The way to good health is to train the body in eating injurious kinds of food until it becomes accustomed to them, by eating one kind of such food every day – never two kinds in the same day; and if the person eats one such kind of food one day, he should not do so again the following morning. If a person has trained his body in this way, his nature will not rebel when circumstances make it necessary for him to eat large quantities of such foods. We know how the body becomes habituated to laxatives when they are taken in excess, with the result that they do not produce their usual effect. Look at the people of al-Andalus: when one of them is suffering from constipation, he has to take three dirhams’ weight of scammony

Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq was one of them: he came from al-Ḥīrah, and he was called al-ʿIbādī. See his biography later in this chapter (8.29).

Hārūn al-Rashīd made as though to take some of it, but Jibrīl stopped him, making a sign to the steward to indicate that he should take the dish away. The caliph was well aware of the byplay. When the table was cleared and Hārūn al-Rashīd washed his hands, Jibrīl left the room.

I obeyed, but I think Jibrīl had spotted me, for he acted very cautious. He went to a room in ʿAwn’s suite of apartments and called for food; when it was brought, it included the fish.

From time to time, feeling thirsty, he would call for a cup of wine, which he would drink neat. Finally he went to sleep. When Hārūn al-Rashīd awoke, he sent for me and asked me what I had found out about Jibrīl, and whether he had eaten any of the fish or not. When I told him what I had seen, he had the three goblets brought to him. In the goblet into which the wine had been poured, the morsel of fish had disintegrated completely; there was not a scrap of it left. In the second goblet, the one which had had snow-cooled water poured into it, the morsel of fish had swollen to more than double its former size, while the contents of the third goblet, the one with the meat and fish, had developed a putrid odour. Hārūn al-Rashīd immediately ordered me to take five thousand dinars to Jibrīl. ‘Who could blame me for regarding that man with affection, considering the way he looks after me?’ he said. Accordingly, I delivered the money to Jibrīl.</p>

I have paid most of the price; the remainder is only a small sum.” “It is yours to spend,” he said, “you never know what may happen.” I then went to the palace, and when the Commander of the Faithful saw me, he asked me what had kept me. “O Commander of the Faithful,” I said, “I have been to visit your father and brothers,” and went on to tell him of their generosity toward me, “merely,” I concluded, “because of my service to you.” “And what am I?” said the caliph. Calling for his horse, he rode to Yaḥyā’s house. “O my father,” he said, “Jibrīl has told me the whole story. And I? am I not one of your children as well?” “O Commander of the Faithful,” said Yaḥyā, “order what you will, and he shall have it,” whereupon the caliph ordered that I should be given 500,000 dirhams.’

                                    where she lived. These were attended exclusively by astrologers and physicians, and whenever she was troubled by some complaint, she would by no means consult a physician without assembling all her regular guests from both professions, who had to wait until she came in and was seated. There were two places where she invariably sat: a window overlooking a large shop just across the way from the main entrance to the house, and a small door opposite the domestic mosque. The astrologers and physicians would take their places near the place she had selected that day, and she would then announce her ailment, whatever it was. The physicians would take counsel together to reach a diagnosis and recommend therapy. If they could not reach agreement, the astrologers would join the discussion, indicating the view that they considered correct. Umm Jaʿfar would then ask the astrologers to select an appropriate time for her therapy. If they did not agree, the physicians would join the discussion, and would give judgement in favour of the time that seemed to them to be logically the most compelling. It so happened on one occasion that Umm Jaʿfar fell ill just when she had joined the hajj-caravan and was about to set out on the pilgrimage, for the last time, as it turned out. The physicians agreed that her disorder required bloodletting and that her legs should be cupped, and the astrologers selected a day suitable for the operation. It was Ramadan, and consequently the cupping could be done only at the end of the day. Her regular consulting astrologers included al-Ḥasan ibn Muḥammad al-Ṭūsī al-Tamīmī, known as al-Abaḥḥ,

Umm Jaʿfar had given instructions that he should attend with the physicians in the expectation that he would benefit by associating with more experienced colleagues, and she had asked all her attendant physicians to teach him and give him their attention, out of her regard for his father, whose care she greatly appreciated.

                                    who was also a monk, and whom Umm Jaʿfar had invited to be present that day. He and the young man were discussing the question of the drinking of water by a person who awakens from sleep in the night. Ibn Dāwūd said, ‘By God, there is no one more stupid than a person who drinks water after having awakened from sleep!’ Just as the young man made that pronouncement, Jibrīl appeared at the door. Even before he had entered the meeting, he said, ‘By God, even more stupid than that is the person who has a fire in his liver and fails to extinguish it.’ He then entered, and asked who it was who had made the statement he had just heard, and upon being told that it had been Ibn Dāwūd, he reprimanded the young man for what he had said: ‘Your father was a distinguished practitioner of the art of medicine, and here you are saying something like what I just heard you say.’ Ibn Dāwūd replied, ‘Sir, may God honour you,

                                    do not hold that a person may drink water upon awakening from sleep, do you?’ ‘I do hold that that is permissible,’ said Jibrīl, ‘in the case of a person with a hot temperament whose stomach is dry, or one who has eaten salt food at his evening meal. However, I say that it is not permissible in the case of a person whose stomach is moist or one with salty phlegm, for in the former case, abstaining from drinking water will help correct the moist condition of the stomach, and in the latter, if the patient does not drink water, part of the salty phlegm will consume the rest.’

                                <p>None of the company said anything to that except me. ‘Abū ʿĪsā,’ I said, ‘there is one more issue.’ ‘What is it?’ asked Jibrīl. ‘You are assuming that the thirsty person knows as much about medicine as you do,’ I said, ‘and will be able to tell whether his thirst is the result of having eaten bitter kinds of food, or whether it is being caused by salty phlegm.’ Jibrīl laughed at that, and then said, ‘When you wake up at night feeling thirsty, put one foot out from under the blanket and lie there for a short time. If your thirst increases, it is being caused by a hot temperament or food that should have been taken with water. In that case, you should get up and have a drink. But if instead you find that you have become somewhat less thirsty, your thirst is the result of salty phlegm, and you should not drink any water.’</p>

However, a recovered patient is at risk of a relapse for a year, unless he has a substantial natural loss of blood, either from the nose or from somewhere lower down, during the course of the illness or some time during the following year. If that happens, he will fully recover.’ ‘A year!’ said Abū Isḥāq in astonishment. ‘Yes, may God make me a ransom for you! And moreover, there is another disease that people tend to take too lightly, and that is measles.

                                    I can never be certain for a full year that a patient who has caught measles will not suffer a relapse, unless, after the disease has run its course, he has a bowel movement that nearly kills him, or else a large abscess develops on him. Either of those assures me that he will recover.’

                                <p>Jibrīl called on Abū Isḥāq one day, following an illness that he had had. Jibrīl had given him permission to eat meat to thicken his blood, but when he sat down he observed that a dish of gruel had been set before his host, and the physician told the steward to have it taken away. I asked him why, and he replied, ‘I have never permitted a caliph who had been feverish for even a single day to eat gruel for a full year.’ Abū Isḥāq asked him, ‘Which kind of gruel do you mean, the kind made with sour milk or the kind without?’ ‘The kind without,’ he replied; ‘I do not allow a patient to eat it for a year. Logically, however, according to the principles of medicine, gruel made with sour milk should not be eaten either, until three years have passed since the illness.’</p>

                                    ‘Hārūn al-Rashīd,’ he said, ‘was a stout man who enjoyed his food and drink. One day, after having eaten a meal comprising a variety of foods, he went to the latrine, where he fainted and had to be carried out. He subsequently sank more deeply into unconsciousness, to such an extent that all the court was sure that he was about to die. I was sent for, and as soon as I arrived I felt his pulse, which was barely perceptible. I recalled that he had been complaining of a feeling of fullness and palpitations, and I said to the company, “He is about to die. He must be cupped immediately.” Al-Maʾmūn agreed to this, and the cupper was sent for. I had the caliph placed in a sitting position. When the cupper had placed the cups and began to suck, I saw that redness had appeared on the skin of the site. This encouraged me, for I knew that Hārūn al-Rashīd was alive. “Make your incision now,” I said to the cupper, and he did. The blood flowed, and I prostrated myself in thanks for the grace of God. The more blood was taken, the more the caliph moved his head and the better his colour became, and finally he asked, “Where am I?” We spoke encouragingly to him and gave him some breast of francolin

I pay him very little, whereas I pay you handsomely. I want every one of you to take a share of what you have acquired from the grace, favour and generosity that I bestow upon you, and give it to him.” They were not slow to comply: they showered him with estates, properties and cash, and by the time he left he was as wealthy as any caliph.’</p>

The captain replied that he earned 300,000 dirhams yearly. The caliph then asked the same question of his chief of police, who answered that he made 500,000 dirhams a year, and his chamberlain, who said that he drew 1,000,000 dirhams per year. Al-Rashīd then said, “I have not been fair to you. Here these officers, who protect me from my human enemies, draw the stipends you have just heard, while you, who protect me from illnesses and distempers, earn only the amount that you mentioned,” and he ordered that I was to be paid 100 million dirhams. “Sire,” I said, “I have no need of such a munificent salary. Only give me the wherewithal to purchase some estates.” He did so, and I used his gifts to purchase estates that bring in one million dirhams in revenue. Furthermore, all my estates are my own absolute property, I do not hold them in fief.’</p>

                                            Serious disturbances occurred in Baghdad, Syria and elsewhere in the context of the civil war in the second decade of the 9th cent. between the caliph al-Amīn and his brother, the future al-Maʾmūn. The ʿAlids mentioned here are rebels fighting against al-Maʾmūn. It seems that the first episode took place during the last years of al-Amīn’s caliphate, but the one mentioned below occurred after his death. In the next paragraph ‘Then, when the Whites …’ refers to the time of al-Maʾmūn’s caliphate. There is much confusion about the use of colours, but in this case it seems clear that it refers to the revolt of the ʿAlid rebel Abū l-Sarāyā (see note below). Baghdad suffered serious civil unrest in the last years of al-Amīn’s caliphate and especially after he was killed, to the extent that in the year 201/817 there were three famous ‘vigilantes’ leading popular movements to fight the evildoers.

                                    He took the physician into his own house and protected him from people who were trying to kill him. In Abū Isḥāq’s own words:

Abū l-Sarāyā was a Shiʿite rebel who revolted against the Abbasids in 199/815, i.e., more than one year after al-Amīn’s death. He seized Kufa and the surrounding areas, including Basra and al-Ahwāz; see

What the ʿAlids have done, on the other hand, is much less horrifying to me. You see, it is utterly impossible for a man like me to live and be regarded with the same benevolence under two different regimes. Had the ʿAlids not seized my estates as they have done, had they spared my factors and the bailiffs responsible for my estates and farms – knowing as they did that I was loyal to my patrons, through whose generosity God has showered me with benefits – it would logically have been because they were saying to one another, “Jibrīl has always been favourable to us while his friends were in power, he has always contributed generously to our cause and provided us with information about his patrons,” and once word got back to the caliph, he would have had me put to death. That is why I am feeling happy: they have taken my property, but my life has been spared. These ignorant miscreants have got my land, but they have not got me.’

                                    I said to my patron, ‘I suspect Jibrīl is planning to do you a bad turn, out of resentment.’ ‘Jibrīl is no threat to me,’ he replied, ‘for I never ask him to prescribe medicine for me or to treat me.’ Subsequently, my patron decided to visit the Commander of the Faithful, al-Maʾmūn. When he was seated in the caliph’s presence, Jibrīl said to al-Maʾmūn, ‘You do not look well, Sire,’ and he went up to him and felt his pulse. Then he said, ‘The Commander of the Faithful should take a drink of oxymel

The physician took his pulse over and over again, but said nothing. Finally, some of his servants came in with a loaf of bread and some squash, beans and a few more such things. Jibrīl said to the caliph, ‘I do not think the Commander of the Faithful should eat any meat today. He should eat only foods like these.’ The caliph ate them, and then took his siesta. When he awoke, Jibrīl said to him, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, the aroma of date wine causes increased heat. It would be best to withdraw,’ and al-Maʾmūn withdrew. All the expense my patron had incurred had gone for naught! Then Jibrīl remarked to me, ‘You know, Abū Khurāsān, the saving on the difference between two hundred and five hundred teak logs hardly outweighs the cost of a visit to the caliph.’

                                    I had this story from Jūrjis ibn Mīkhāʾīl, who had it from Jibrīl, his maternal uncle. Jibrīl had great respect for that young man because of his extensive learning. I myself do not know of anyone of that family, apart from Jibrīl himself, who was more learned than Jūrjis ibn Mīkhāʾīl, although he was a very vain and frivolous youth. Jibrīl, he said, had told him that on 1 Muḥarram 187 [30 December 802], he had been concerned because Hārūn al-Rashīd had no appetite. He could find nothing from an examination of the caliph’s urine or from his pulse to indicate that he was ill, so he said to al-Rashīd, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, you are in excellent health, praised be God, so I am at a loss to explain why you have not finished your breakfast.’ After I had said something to this effect several times, the caliph said to me, ‘I think Baghdad is unhealthy, yet I don’t want to go far away just now. Do you know of some nearby place where the air is wholesome?’ ‘What about al-Ḥīrah?’ I suggested. ‘I have stayed in al-Ḥīrah any number of times,’ said he, ‘and my visits are a nuisance for ʿAwn al-ʿIbādī. Besides, it’s too far away.’ ‘O Commander of the Faithful,’ I said, ‘al-Anbār

                                    Early Friday morning, the caliph went out on horseback, accompanied by Jaʿfar ibn Yaḥyā, for a breath of fresh air. As I watched, I saw that he had put his arm into Jaʿfar’s sleeve all the way to his body, drawn him close, embraced him, and kissed his eyes. They trotted off for a distance of more than 1,000 cubits, hand in hand all the way, and then returned. ‘By my life,’ said Hārūn al-Rashīd to Jaʿfar, ‘you started off with a drink this morning, and you have made it a day of happiness. Now I am going to be occupied with my household.’ Then, turning to me, he said, ‘Jibrīl, I am going to have something to eat. You stay with my brother here and join him in his happiness.’ Accordingly, I went with Jaʿfar, who had some food brought, and we ate together. He then sent for the blind singer, Abū Zakkār, to perform for the two of us alone. One servant after another came in and whispered something to Jaʿfar, and every time this happened he would sigh and say, ‘This looks bad, Abū ʿĪsā: the Commander of the Faithful still has eaten nothing. I fear that he is ill, and that is why he has no appetite.’ Every time he wished to drink a cup, he would tell Abū Zakkār to sing these lines:

When I entered, there was al-Rashīd with Jaʿfar’s head in a large basin in front of him. ‘Good evening, Jibrīl,’ he said. ‘Weren’t you asking me this morning why I was not hungry?’ ‘Yes, I was, O Commander of the Faithful,’ I said. ‘It was because I was thinking about that which you see before you,’ he explained, ‘but tonight, Jibrīl, tonight I am as hungry as a camel. Bring on supper! You will be astonished at how much more I can eat now. I was eating a bite at a time so as not to overburden my stomach and make myself ill.’ He then called for food, fell to at once and ate heartily.</p>

                                    In the caliphate of the Commander of the Faithful, Muḥammad al-Amīn, Ibrahīm was absent from the caliph’s council meeting one evening, having taken a dose of physic. Jibrīl ibn Bukhtīshūʿ called on him the following morning to convey greetings from al-Amīn and to ask him how his condition was responding to the physic. Then he came close and murmured, ‘The Commander of the Faithful is making preparations to send ʿAlī ibn ʿĪsā ibn Māhān

Then he had me sit in the captain’s place and had Abū ʿIṣmah sit in my place until daybreak, and he said to us, “There, I have made you trade places: each of you is now assigned the other’s duties.” I thought to myself, “God must be about to withdraw His grace from al-Amīn, considering the way he himself abuses it. Here he has made a Christian responsible for guarding and protecting him, and Christianity is the most submissive of religions, for no other religion requires its followers to submit to the hateful actions of an enemy, such as willingly performing labour on demand, walking an extra mile when compelled to walk one, or turning the other cheek when slapped in the face. Only my religion is like that. So I judged that his power must be about to wane. And then, when he chose as his physician – the person in charge of maintaining his life, ensuring his physical welfare and serving his nature – Abū ʿIṣmah, of all people, who knows absolutely nothing whatever of these matters, I judged that God would surely not prolong his life, and that his end was near.” Abū Isḥāq

This was before Jibrīl had entered the employ of al-Rashīd. He greeted al-ʿAbbās with ‘May God exalt the emir! How is Your Excellency this morning?’ ‘Just as you would like to see me,’ said al-ʿAbbās. ‘Not at all: not as I would like, not as God would like, and not as Satan would like either,’ returned Jibrīl. ‘What the deuce do you mean, God’s curse on you?’ said al-ʿAbbās angrily. ‘I have proof,’ said Jibrīl. ‘Out with your proof, then,’ said al-ʿAbbās, ‘otherwise I’ll mend your manners for you: you’ll never enter any house of mine again.’ ‘What I should like,’ said Jibrīl, ‘would be for you to be Commander of the Faithful. Is that the case?’ ‘No’ admitted al-ʿAbbās. ‘And what God would like,’ Jibrīl continued, ‘would be for His servants to obey him in respect of the things He has commanded and prohibited. Is that the case with you, O emir?’ ‘No,’ said al-ʿAbbās again, ‘I ask pardon of God.’ ‘And what Satan would like,’ Jibrīl went on, ‘would be for God’s servants to disobey Him and reject Him as Lord. Is that the case with you, O emir?’ ‘No,’ said al-ʿAbbās, ‘but don’t let me hear you saying this sort of thing ever again.’</p>

                                <p>When al-Maʾmūn decided to undertake an expedition into Roman territory in the year 213/828, Jibrīl was very ill. When al-Maʾmūn saw what a serious state he was in, he asked the physician to send his son Bukhtīshūʿ to accompany the expedition. Jibrīl sent for him, and the young man proved to be much like his father as far as his intelligence, knowledge and general merit went. Al-Maʾmūn interviewed him, and when he heard Bukhtīshūʿ’s answers to his questions, the caliph was very pleased, showed him the utmost respect, made him an important member of his entourage, and took him along on his expedition against the Romans.</p>

                                    After al-Maʾmūn’s departure, Jibrīl’s illness dragged on until finally it became apparent that his death was imminent. He made a will naming al-Maʾmūn his executor, handed it to his son-in-law Mīkhāʾīl, and then died. He was given a finer funeral than anyone in his position had ever had, thanks to his meritorious actions and charitable efforts. He was buried in the Monastery of St. Sergius in al-Madāʾin.

Her name is connected with the fall of the Barmakids through her marriage with Jaʿfar ibn Yaḥyā al-Barmakī. According to al-Ṭabarī, Hārūn could not bear to do without the society of either his sister or J̱aʿfar, so that, in order to have them both with him at the same time, he had them contract a marriage of convenience. The couple themselves, however, were soon dissatisfied with this arrangement, and when Hārūn discovered what was really going on, he had Jaʿfar executed (see Ch. 8.3.16 above). Serious historians, beginning with Ibn Khaldūn, give little credence to this account. Al-ʿAbbāsah makes an appearance in Ch. 12, where we are informed of her subsequent marriage to a cousin of Hārūn al-Rashīd’s, Ibrāhīm ibn Ṣāliḥ. See

                            hated Bukhtīshūʿ, for his virtuous character, piety, honour, generosity and general decency made them envious. Accordingly, they took advantage of every opportunity to besmirch his reputation in al-Wāthiq’s eyes whenever they were alone with the caliph, with the result that in the year 230/844–845, al-Wāthiq turned against him, confiscated his property and much of his wealth, and had him exiled to Gondēshāpūr. But then the caliph fell gravely ill with dropsy; he dispatched an emissary to bring Bukhtīshūʿ back to Baghdad, but died before the physician arrived.

                            however, Bukhtīshūʿ’s fortunes improved: he became a man of enormous importance, prestige, reputation, prowess and wealth, His apparel, perfumes, carpets, estates, opulent lifestyle and conspicuous expenditure beggared description, with the result that the caliph became envious and had him arrested.

                            The following account is taken from another chronicle. Bukhtīshūʿ ibn Jibrīl stood high in favour with al-Mutawakkil, but he made the mistake of treating the caliph with excessive familiarity, and as a result al-Mutawakkil turned against him, confiscating his property and sending him to the City of Peace.

                            Subsequently, however, the caliph was afflicted with an attack of colic, whereupon he sent for Bukhtīshūʿ and begged his pardon. The physician treated him, and he recovered. The grateful caliph responded by restoring him to grace, returning the possessions that he had previously confiscated.

Abū l-ʿAbbās al-Khaṣībī was an unscrupulous man, and they conspired to have al-Mutawakkil assassinated and al-Muntaṣir installed as caliph in his place. ‘What made you advise al-Muntaṣir to appoint al-Khaṣībī as his secretary?’ said Bukhtīshūʿ to the vizier, ‘you know what an unscrupulous rogue he is.’ This led ʿAbd Allāh to imagine that the physician had got wind of the conspiracy. The vizier reported what Bukhtīshūʿ had said to him: ‘You know how close the caliph and Bukhtīshūʿ are,’ he said to the others; ‘in my view, we shall have to abandon our plan. Is there anything we can do?’ They finally decided that once the caliph was well into his cups, al-Muntaṣir should tear his clothes and bespatter them with blood, and then go to see his father. ‘When he asks you what on earth has happened,’ his fellow conspirators said to him, ‘you must say that Bukhtīshūʿ fomented a dispute between you and your brother, in the course of which you nearly killed one another. “O Commander of the Faithful,” you will say, “that physician ought to be removed from our midst.” He will tell you to do what you think best, and we shall exile Bukhtīshūʿ. By the time the caliph thinks to ask for him, we shall have accomplished our design.’ This was done, and brought about Bukhtīshūʿ’s downfall and the assassination of al-Mutawakkil.

As he was taking his leave, he said to al-Muhtadī, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, I have not had my blood let or swallowed any medicine for forty years, and now the astrologers have determined that I am to die in the course of this year. I am not dismayed at the prospect of death, but I am sorrowful at having to be parted from you.’ The caliph spoke to him consolingly, saying that astrologers were seldom right. In the event, however, he did die: after he had left that evening, the caliph never saw him again.</p>

This made Aḥmad ibn Abī Du’ād angry. ‘Ibrāhīm,’ he said, ‘when you argue with a person at a hearing in our presence, it is fitting for you to seek a straight, well-trodden road; you should be calm and your words moderate. You must allow the caliph’s sessions their due measure of mediation, gravitas, competence, and search for truth, for that is more fitting for you, and more becoming a man of your lineage and importance. Do not be hasty, for haste is often followed by regret. May God protect you from error and from foolish words and actions; may He grant you His grace in full, as He did to your fathers before you, for surely your Lord is all-knowing and all-wise.’

I shall henceforth refrain from saying or doing anything that would cause you to think the less of me, diminish my worth in your eyes, or fall short in my duty of offering apologies. I therefore do beg your forgiveness for this lapse, as one admitting his fault and acknowledging his offence. Anger lashes me on to do its will, but a man such as yourself teaches me forbearance. That is God’s way with you, and with us by your example. He is sufficient for us, an excellent guardian. I hereby renounce my share in this piece of land and cede it to Bukhtīshūʿ. May this be adequate compensation for the wrong I have done him, for expenditure that serves to teach a lesson is not wasted. God grants success.’</p>

                                    I called on Bukhtīshūʿ (the old man said) on a very hot day. I found him seated in a sitting-room cooled by several punkahs, with two windows for ventilation and a blacked-out window between them. In the centre was a pavilion with an embroidered cover the material of which was impregnated with rose water, camphor and sandalwood oil. Bukhtīshūʿ, to my astonishment, was wearing a heavy robe of
                                    <hi rend="italic">saʿīdī</hi>
                                    Yemeni material and wrapped up in a shawl. When I joined him in the pavilion, however, I found the air icy cold. He laughed, and ordered his servants to bring a robe and shawl for me. ‘Boy,’ he said to one of them, ‘uncover the sides of the pavilion,’ and there were a number of open doors, and beyond them, banks of snow, with servants fanning it. That was the source of the cold that I had felt. Bukhtīshūʿ then called for supper, and a most elegant table was brought in, with dainties of every kind upon it. Then came roast chickens, done to a turn; the cook entered and gave each of them a shake, whereupon it fell to pieces. Seeing how impressed I was with their colour and the tenderness of the meat, he explained that the chickens were fed nothing but almonds and cottonseed, and were given pomegranate juice to drink.

                                    I called on him again one bitterly cold day in the dead of winter. I found him wearing a padded robe and gown, sitting in a sort of pergola inside his house, in the midst of a most beautiful garden. The pergola was covered with a fine display of sable fur, surmounted by a cover of dyed silk, felt from the western lands, and Yemeni leather mats. Before Bukhtīshūʿ stood a gilded brazier, made of silver and pierced with holes, in which a servant dressed in a resplendent tunic of gold and silver brocade was keeping a fire of aloes-wood burning. I joined him in the pergola, and found that it was very warm inside. Bukhtīshūʿ laughed and ordered the servants to bring me a tunic of gold and silver brocade as well. He then told them to uncover the sides of the pergola, and I beheld adjoining compartments with wooden lattices over iron ones, and in them braziers in which fires of tamarisk

Bukhtīshūʿ then ordered supper, which proved to be excellent and impeccable as usual. Some very pale chickens were served. I did not like the look of them, for I feared that they were underdone, but the cook came in and shook them, and they fell to pieces. I asked him about them, and he said that the chickens were fed on shelled almonds and given milk to drink.

                            It was summer, and the weather was very hot. ‘Everything seems to be in order,’ said Bukhtīshūʿ to his friends and associates, ‘except that we don’t have enough canvas for punkahs.’ Accordingly, he sent out emissaries to buy all the canvas they could find in Samarra. They brought back the canvas, and they also brought with them all the upholsterers

They cut enough canvas to make punkahs for the entire house – courtyards, chambers, salons, apartments and latrines – so that wherever the caliph might go, he would find a punkah. Then Bukhtīshūʿ thought of the smell of new canvas, which disappears only after the fabric has been in use for a time. He ordered his servants to buy as many melons as they could find in the town, and then he had most of his staff and slave-boys sit and rub the canvas with the melons all night long, with the result that in the morning the smell had vanished. He then had his servants hang the punkahs in all the places mentioned above.

By giving each one his own basket, I have ensured that there was enough for all.’ The caliph looked at the banquet and pronounced it most splendid.</p>

                            Al-Mutawakkil then said that he wished to take a nap, and asked Bukhtīshūʿ to put him in a well-lighted room that was free of flies, thinking thereby to cause him embarrassment. But Bukhtīshūʿ had had urns of treacle placed on the roofs of the house, so that the flies would gather there, and there was not a single fly in the lower apartments. Bukhtīshūʿ ushered the caliph into a large square chamber the entire ceiling of which consisted of glazed skylights, so that the room was full of light. It was fitted with punkahs, and under the punkahs could be glimpsed fine fabric impregnated with rose water, sandalwood oil and camphor. When al-Mutawakkil lay down for his nap, he began to smell extraordinarily sweet odours that he was unable to identify, for he had not seen any perfumes, fruits or flowers in the chamber, nor any niches or alcoves behind the punkahs where anything of that sort might have been put. The caliph was so puzzled that he told al-Fatḥ ibn Khāqān to follow up the fragrance and find out where it came from. He went out and walked around the chamber, and found outside it, in every possible nook and cranny, small, narrow window-like apertures stuffed full of aromatic plants, fruits, perfumes and scents, with mandrake

Al-Fatḥ saw servants who had been stationed at these apertures, and by each servant was a brazier containing incense, which was burning and giving off its aromatic smoke. The inner side of the chamber was painted with a coat of white lead pierced with tiny, imperceptible holes, and it was through these that the delightful odours and perfumes were wafted in.

                            When al-Fatḥ returned and told al-Mutawakkil what he had seen, the caliph was greatly astonished, and was consumed with envy of Bukhtīshūʿ because of his generosity and the impeccable hospitality he had provided. He left the house without spending the remainder of the day there, pretexting a languor, and thereafter felt a brooding hatred toward the physician. A few days later, Bukhtīshūʿ was out of favour: the caliph dismissed him and confiscated an incalculable quantity of wealth from him. His wardrobe was found to include 4,000 pairs of pantaloons made of fine

Bukhtīshūʿ called on the prince while the physicians were attending him, and saw for himself the patient’s refusal to take anything. Bukhtīshūʿ spoke with him, and they joked with each other. Al-Muʿtazz put his hand into the sleeve of a heavy Yemeni embroidered robe that Bukhtīshūʿ was wearing, and said, ‘What a splendid thing this is!’ ‘Your Highness is quite right,’ said Bukhtīshūʿ, ‘there is nothing like it, and it cost me a thousand dinars. Now, eat two apples for me, and this robe is yours.’ At that, al-Muʿtazz called for apples and ate two of them. Bukhtīshūʿ then said to him, ‘You know, Your Highness, a robe like this should have a shirt to go with it. I happen to have one that would go with it perfectly. If you will just drink a cup of oxymel for me, you shall have that shirt,’ whereupon al-Muʿtazz swallowed a draught of oxymel. This treatment was consistent with his impetuous nature, and he recovered; he took the robe and shirt, and the illness left him. Al-Mutawakkil was grateful to Bukhtīshūʿ ever afterward for what he had done for al-Muʿtazz.

                            Once, in very hot weather, al-Mutawakkil said that he would like to have some mustard with his meal, but his physicians told him not to, because of his irascible temperament and hot liver, and the harmful effect of mustard. ‘I shall give you some,’ said Bukhtīshūʿ, ‘and you may hold me responsible for any harm it does you.’ ‘Pray proceed,’ said the caliph. Bukhtīshūʿ instructed the servants to bring him a squash, which he coated with clay and placed in an oven, and then extracted the liquid from it. He then had the mustard hulled and mixed with the liquid from the squash. ‘Mustard,’ he explained, ‘belongs to the fourth degree of heat, and squash belongs to the fourth degree of moisture, and consequently the one offsets the other. You may eat your fill.’ The caliph spent a comfortable night, and when he still felt well the following morning, he ordered that Bukhtīshūʿ should be given a purse of 300,000 dirhams and thirty chests of clothing of various kinds.

                                    Further evidence of this is to be found in an account that I heard from one of my masters. He said that Bukhtīshūʿ had paid a visit to al-Mutawakkil one day. The caliph was sitting on a divan in the middle of his private apartment, and Bukhtīshūʿ sat down beside him, as he usually did. Bukhtīshūʿ was wearing an outer robe of Roman silk brocade, which was split a little up the front. As the caliph talked with him, he took to playing with the split, which he followed up as far as the edge of the waistband of Bukhtīshūʿ’s pantaloons. They had reached a point in their conversation where al-Mutawakkil had occasion to ask Bukhtīshūʿ, ‘How can you tell when a confused person is in need of firm treatment and stability?’ ‘When he has followed the split in his physician’s robe up as far as the waistband of his pantaloons,’ answered Bukhtīshūʿ, ‘
                                    <hi rend="italic">then</hi>
                                    we adopt firm treatment.’ The caliph fell over and lay on his back laughing, and awarded Bukhtīshūʿ splendid robes of honour and a substantial purse on the spot.

He and the caliph were on friendly terms, and al-Mutawakkil said to him, ‘And what have you brought me today, eh?’ ‘My gift is nothing but a mere beggarly trinket, of no value whatever,’ Bukhtīshūʿ replied, ‘but such as it is, here it is,’ and from his sleeve he drew out an

He laid it before al-Mutawakkil. ‘I have never seen anything like this,’ said the caliph, ‘where did you get it from?’ ‘From some very good people,’ answered Bukhtīshūʿ, and then he added, ‘My father received 300,000 dinars three times over from Umm Jaʿfar Zubaydah

                            for treating her for three conditions. The first was an obstruction in her throat from which she was in danger of suffocation. He advised bleeding, cold compresses, and a broth which he described in detail. The broth was prepared in accordance with his directions, and was brought in in a great porcelain bowl, marvellous to behold, with that spoon in it. My father made a sign to me that I should pick it up, and I did so, wrapping it in my cloak, but the servant grabbed at it and tried to pull it away from me. Zubaydah said to him, “Gently; just tell him to put it back.” My father offered her ten thousand dinars for it, but she refused. “Your Highness,” he said, “my son has never stolen in his life. I beg you, do not think ill of him for his first attempt, for you will break his heart.” She laughed at that, and gave him the spoon.’

                        <p>Bukhtīshūʿ was then asked about the other two occasions. He explained that Zubaydah had consulted his father about a deterioration in the smell of the breath, which one of her immediate circle had informed her she had. Death, she had said, would be preferable. He ordered her to fast until the afternoon, and then he force-fed her pickled fish and gave her the dregs of poor-quality date-wine to drink, which nauseated her and caused her to vomit. He repeated this treatment for three days, and then he said to her, ‘Go and breathe in the face of the person who told you you had bad breath, and ask her whether it has now vanished.’</p>
                        <p>The third occasion was when Zubaydah was near death from a severe case of hiccups; her hiccupping could be heard from outside the chamber where she lay. Bukhtīshūʿ’s father had ordered the servants to carry some large jars up to the roof overlooking the courtyard, line them up on the edge all the way around, and fill them with water, with a servant behind each jar. When he clapped his hands, they pushed the jars over the edge, making such a crash that Zubaydah started up in alarm – and found that her hiccups had vanished.</p>

He then called for trays containing superb mountain plums. Bukhtīshūʿ began to cut them open and eat them, until he had finished them and quenched his thirst. By then his face had reverted to its normal appearance. “Tell me what that was about,” I said to him, “Well, I had a real craving for plums,” he explained, “but I feared they would not be good for me, so I used the theriac and wine, dressing the millstones, so to speak, to ensure that they would grind properly.” ’

                        <p>The following account is also related by Abū ʿAlī al-Qiyānī at first hand from his father, who in turn had heard it from Muḥammad ibn Dāwūd ibn al-Jarrāḥ. The latter had told him:</p>

                                <p>Bukhtīshūʿ the physician was a friend of my father’s. We had a companion who enjoyed his food and was very fat. Whenever he met Bukhtīshūʿ, he would say to him, ‘I should like you to make up some diet medicine for me’. He badgered him in this fashion until finally Bukhtīshūʿ wrote out a prescription for him for a preparation containing colocynth pulp and scammony. The physician said to my father, ‘The whole point is that he must keep to a light regime, and then discipline himself to refrain from eating anything harmful.’</p>

                                    He dined at our house on the day he began his diet, and he took only three

                                    of stewed meat, which he ate with three

                                    s of bread. However, when he had finished it, he asked for more. My father refused, and subsequently kept him in his house until the day was over, meanwhile sending a messenger to his wife to tell her that she should not let him eat anything when he went home. When he realized that the man was becoming restless, he let him go home. Once there, he asked his wife for something to eat, but there was nothing to be had. As it happened, however, she had overlooked a pot on a shelf with breadcrumbs in it; the man found it and ate several
                                    <hi rend="italic">raṭl</hi>
                                    s of the breadcrumbs. The following morning, he took the medicine, but was puzzled, for it had gone down to a full stomach, and consequently had no effect. As the day advanced, he said to himself, ‘Bukhtīshūʿ is a fool,’ and proceeded to devour ten
                                    <hi rend="italic">raṭls</hi>
                                    of slices of meat and ten

                                    s of bread and to drink a carafe of cold water. An hour later, the medicine was trying to find a way out, either at the upper end or at the lower, but was blocked in both directions, and consequently the man’s abdomen swelled up and his breathing became stertorous; it appeared that he was about to die. His wife screamed and begged my father for help, and he had the man carried in a litter to Bukhtīshūʿ.
                                </p>
                                <p>It was a very hot day, and Bukhtīshūʿ was in a sour mood at being called out of his house. He asked about the patient until he had heard his entire history. As it happened, there were more than 200 birds in Bukhtīshūʿ’s house, sandpipers, rails (?), egrets (?) and the like. There was a large pool for them, filled with water, by now warmed by the sun, in which the birds had deposited their droppings. Bukhtīshūʿ had his servants bring some ground salt and threw it into the water of the pool, where it dissolved. He then had them bring a funnel, and poured this mixture down the man’s throat as he lay unconscious, warning everyone to stand well back, and with reason, as the patient soon vomited and voided copiously. He was very weak afterward, but his strength was sustained with perfumes and francolin broth. A few days later, he had recovered, much to our surprise. We asked Bukhtīshūʿ about him, and he replied, ‘Thinking about the case, I saw that if I were to apply a conventional remedy, the patient would die, because of the length of time it would take to prepare and administer the medicine. We treat severe cases of colic with pigeon manure and salt; there was my pool, with its water that had been warmed by the sun, with the necessary quantity of bird droppings in it, and it was more readily available than anything else, so I treated him with it, and by the grace of God, it worked.’</p>

Ibn ʿAbbād was well known for his accomplishments, and accordingly ʿAḍud al-Dawlah gave orders that all the physicians from Baghdad and elsewhere should be brought before him so that he could consult them to determine which of them was most suitable for him to send to attend the vizier. The assembled physicians unanimously advised him to send Jibrīl, for they were envious of his preferment and welcomed an opportunity of having him removed from their midst. ‘To attend such a man as this,’ they said, ‘there could be no better choice than Abū ʿĪsā Jibrīl, for he reasons incomparably, and moreover he speaks Persian.’ This verdict met with ʿAḍud al-Dawlah’s approval: he ordered that Jibrīl should be provided with funds adequate to cover the cost of the journey, a fine mount and pack-mules, and sent him off.

When he arrived, he found that his host had invited learned men from various disciplines, and had selected a man of the city who had some knowledge of the art of medicine to debate with him. This person asked Jibrīl various questions about the pulse. Jibrīl saw what the game was, and proceeded to expound aspects of the matter that were beyond the scope of the questions, going into detailed explanations that none of the party had ever heard of, raising difficult points and then resolving them so impressively that there was not a man in the room who could withhold his respect and admiration.

                                    Al-Ṣāḥib ibn ʿAbbād bestowed splendid robes of honour upon him that day, and asked him to write a treatise exclusively devoted to the ailments affecting every part of the body, from head to foot. The result of this commission was Jibrīl’s

                                    ), which discusses nothing but the disorders of every part of the body, from head to foot, just as the vizier had requested. Al-Ṣāḥib ibn ʿAbbād was greatly impressed with it and gave him a present worth 1,000 dinars. After that, Jibrīl never tired of saying, ‘I wrote 200 pages, and I received 1,000 dinars for them.’ When ʿAḍud al-Dawlah heard of the matter, he was filled with admiration and held Jibrīl in higher esteem than ever. When Jibrīl left Rayy and returned to Baghdad, he brought with him splendid apparel and a numerous train of slaves, domestic staff and servants. ʿAḍud al-Dawlah received him as generously as anyone could have wished.

                                    the king of the Daylamites, fell ill. His condition deteriorated to such an extent that a constant watch was kept on him. As he wasted away, his apprehension grew. He was attended by twelve physicians, from Rayy and other cities, but their ministrations merely aggravated his illness. Finally he wrote to al-Ṣāḥib ibn ʿAbbād, asking him to send a physician. Ibn ʿAbbād replied that he knew of no one who was fit to take on such a case but Abū ʿĪsā Jibrīl, whereupon Khusrawshāh asked him to write to the physician and ask him, in the name of their close relations, to come to his aid. He also wrote to ʿAḍud al-Dawlah, asking him to send Jibrīl, adding that he was so ill that there was no time to be lost, and the emir responded, sending the physician in honourable style. When he reached the court of the Daylamite king, he said to him, ‘I will treat you only if all these physicians hovering about are dismissed.’ The king dismissed them, thanking them for their services, and Jibrīl stayed with him. Khusrawshāh subsequently asked him to compose a treatise on the course of the disease as it had actually occurred, indicating the treatment that should be selected and relied on. Jibrīl did so, entitling the work

In response, Jibrīl produced a treatise elegantly demonstrating the truth of his assertion. At that time he was also busily engaged on the writing of his

Besides these, he composed numerous smaller works, including one on why wine is used in the Eucharist although it is of its essence a prohibited substance, and one discussing the reasons why things are lawful or prohibited.

One of the women of the harem fell acutely ill, and Jibrīl advised that a phial of her urine should be taken. As it happened, he was with Ḥusām al-Dawlah when a slave-girl brought the phial to him. He examined it, then turned to Ḥusām al-Dawlah and said, ‘This woman is going to die.’ Ḥusām al-Dawlah was distressed at this pronouncement, and the slave-girl, seeing how moved he was, shrieked, tore her clothes, and made as though to retire, but Jibrīl called her back and said to her, ‘Is there something you haven’t told me about this woman?’ The girl swore that no one had done anything that was not accepted practice. ‘Have you by any chance been dyeing her with henna?’, he asked. When the girl admitted that that was the case, he scolded her, and then, turning to Ḥusām al-Dawlah, he said, ‘Good news, O emir: she will be better in three days,’ and so it proved.

                        <p>An entertaining anecdote is told about Jibrīl in Mayyāfāriqīn. In the first year of his residence there, he gave the emir a laxative draught, saying to him, ‘It is important for you to take this medicine first thing tomorrow morning.’ Mumahhid al-Dawlah deliberately took it late in the evening instead. Next morning, Jibrīl rode to the palace, where he went to see the emir, took his pulse, and enquired about the draught he had given him. Mumahhid al-Dawlah, by way of putting the physician to the test, replied that it had had no effect. ‘Your pulse tells me otherwise,’ said Jibrīl, ‘and it is a more reliable informant.’ The emir laughed, and then he asked, ‘How many bowel movements do you think I shall have with this medicine?’ ‘In the case of the emir, twenty-five,’ replied Jibrīl, ‘for someone else, possibly more or fewer.’ ‘Thus far I have had twenty-three,’ said Mumahhid al-Dawlah. ‘You will soon have the remainder, just as I said,’ grunted Jibrīl. He was offended; after laying out a course of treatment for the emir to follow, he took his leave and ordered his horse saddled and all preparations made for departure. When Mumahhid al-Dawlah heard of this, he sent Jibrīl a message enquiring why he was leaving. ‘A man like myself is not to be put to the test,’ he replied, ‘for my renown is such as to make trial unnecessary.’ The emir was so pleased with this answer that he had a mule and a well-filled sack of dirhams sent to Jibrīl.</p>
                        <p>During this time, the king of the Daylamites sent Jibrīl a number of flattering letters inviting him to pay a visit to his court. Jibrīl wrote to Mumahhid al-Dawlah requesting permission to go, but the emir refused, and as a result Jibrīl stayed in Mayyāfāriqīn for another three years. He died there on Friday 8 Rajab in the year 396 of the Hijrah [10 April 1006], when he was 85 years of age, and was buried in an oratory just outside the city.</p>

                                    Khaṣīb was suspected of having caused his death, and accordingly was arrested and thrown into prison, where he remained until he died. When he became ill, he examined his own urine (for he was a learned physician), and declared, ‘According to Galen, anyone suffering from this ailment is doomed once his urine has become like this.’ ‘Galen may have been mistaken,’ said his friends. ‘Never have I hoped for that to be the case so ardently as now,’ he replied. But evidently Galen had not been mistaken, for Khaṣīb died of his illness.

Upon leaving the palace, the maid showed the phial to Abū Quraysh, and he pronounced the urine to be that of a pregnant woman who was carrying a boy. The maid ran back to her mistress with this good news, and al-Khayzurān ordered her to return and obtain further information. When she did so, Abū Quraysh said to her, ‘I told you the truth, but it is good news, and you owe me something for it.’ ‘How much?’ enquired the maid. ‘A bowl of sweet pudding and a fine robe,’ he replied. ‘If this is true,’ the maid said, ‘you have just earned the best and finest of the goods that this world has to offer,’ and off she went.

In due course, al-Khayzurān gave birth to Hārūn, whereupon al-Mahdī sent for Abū Quraysh, had him brought into his presence, spoke with him personally, and inundated him with robes of honour and bags of dinars and dirhams piled up higher than his head. The caliph allowed Hārūn and Mūsā to sit on the physician’s knees and addressed him familiarly as ‘Abū Quraysh,’ which means ‘father of the Arabs’,

In due course, al-Mahdī died and was succeeded by Hārūn al-Rashīd. Jūrjis then died in his turn, and his son became subordinate to Abū Quraysh in al-Rashīd’s service.

The last of them to arrive was ʿĪsā Abū Quraysh, and by then the others, having despaired of stopping the headache, had withdrawn to consult together. “By the time that lot have reached a consensus, the man will have gone blind,” said he, and forthwith he called for some oil of violets, rose water, wine vinegar and snow. He poured two dirhams’ weight of the oil into a bowl, poured some of the vinegar and some of the rose water over it, and crumbled some of the snow into it, and then tilted and swirled the bowl until all its contents were mixed together. Next, he ordered the servants to place a handful of the mixture in the centre of ʿAlī ibn al-Mahdī’s forehead, to wait until the skin had absorbed it, and then to repeat the procedure. After this had been done three or four times, the headache had subsided and my father was better.’

He told her to sit down, and when she did so, he sprang up and embraced her in friendly fashion, as though she had been an acquaintance whom he had met. Then, clutching her tightly, he went into a trance. The bystanders attempted to unclasp his arms from her neck, but to no avail. Physicians were summoned, and their unanimous verdict was that he was suffering from an attack of paralysis.

Neither these men nor any of their line will ever be stricken by paralysis, unless they sow their seed in Roman or Slav concubines or the like. In that case their descendants from those concubines might be liable to attacks of paralysis, but not otherwise.’ He called for a cupper and had al-Mahdī bled, and by God! no sooner had the first measure of blood been drawn than the caliph drew back his arms; at the second, he began to speak, and he had recovered his senses before the cupper had completed his work. He sent for Umm Asmāʾ and impregnated her then and there with his daughter Asmāʾ.

                                    When Ibrāhīm ibn al-Mahdī was very poorly with the illness from which he ultimately died, his jaw became slack and his tongue thick within his mouth, with the result that he had difficulty speaking. When he did speak, persons hearing him had the impression that he was paralysed. He sent for me at the time of the afternoon prayer on Tuesday, the sixth day of Ramadan of the year 224 [22 July 839], and said to me, ‘Do you not find it extraordinary that I should have been stricken with this disorder, which has not affected any of my father’s offspring apart from Ismāʿīl ibn Mūsā the Commander of the Faithful and poor Muḥammad ibn Ṣāliḥ, and in Muḥammad’s case it was only because both his mother and his father’s mother were Roman women. Ismāʿīl’s mother was Roman too. But

                                    At this, I realized that he had remembered his mother telling him what ʿĪsā Abū Quraysh had said about al-Mahdī and his offspring, that none of them would be affected by paralysis unless they should sow their seed in Roman women, and was hoping that in his particular case the paralysis would not prove fatal. Accordingly, I said to him, ‘I cannot imagine why you should think such a malady would strike you, for your mother, she who gave birth to you, was a Dunbāwandī woman, and Dunbāwand

                                    was so obese that he appeared to be at risk of death from the very weight of his flesh. Hārūn al-Rashīd was very concerned at this; he became so distressed that he could not enjoy the pleasures of food and drink. He ordered his physicians to treat ʿĪsā ibn Jaʿfar, but all of them denied any knowledge of a means that would serve, thereby exacerbating Hārūn al-Rashīd’s anxiety. But ʿĪsā, known as Abū Quraysh, went to see al-Rashīd in private and said to him:

                                        <p>O Commander of the Faithful, your brother ʿĪsā ibn Jaʿfar is endowed with a solid stomach and a body that readily absorbs nourishment. Nothing bad ever happens to him; whatever he wishes for comes true beyond his dreams. He has never been afflicted with the death of a loved one, financial catastrophe, or injustice at the hands of jacks-in-office; he has never been treated harshly. When men’s natures and circumstances are not perturbed, they may experience now illness, now health, now sadness, now joy; they may dream of dreadful things or pleasant things, they may feel horror on some occasions and happiness on others. No man is safe from destruction if his flesh increases until his bones are too weak to support it, his breathing is impeded, and the powers of his brain and liver are annihilated, and where this is the case, the life is destroyed. As regards your brother, unless you show some sternness toward him, change your behaviour somewhat, perhaps distress him by confiscating some of his money or take some of his women away from him, why, his obesity may increase until it kills him. If you want to keep him alive, I urge you to treat him in that way, for otherwise you soon may not have a brother.</p>

                        <p>‘I know,’ replied Hārūn al-Rashīd, ‘you have told me before, but I really cannot alter the way I treat him or deliberately set out to worry him in some way. If you know of some means of dealing with his case, please proceed with it. As soon as I see that he has lost weight, you shall have ten thousand dinars from me, and I will see to it that you receive the same amount from him.’ ‘Well,’ said Abū Quraysh, ‘I do have an idea, but I am afraid that it may rouse ʿĪsā ibn Jaʿfar to a murderous rage and I will be killed then and there. Therefore, O Commander of the Faithful, will you send a sturdy servant with me, accompanied by a number of men who will protect me from him, in case he orders me killed.’ Hārūn al-Rashīd gave the necessary orders, and Abū Quraysh went to see ʿĪsā ibn Jaʿfar. After taking his pulse, he informed the fat man that he would have to take his pulse for three days before he would be able to suggest any treatment. At this, ʿĪsā told him to go away and come back later. Abū Quraysh complied, returning on the second and third days. Having completed the task of taking ʿĪsā’s pulse, the physician said to him, ‘This is most fortunate, a recommendation that comes neither too soon nor too late, and I consider that the emir would do well to observe it. If nothing untoward happens within the next forty days, I shall administer a treatment that will have you cured of your illness within a mere three days, and you will in better health than before.’</p>

                            The physician rose from his seat, having implanted such fear in ʿĪsā ibn Jaʿfar’s heart that he was unable to eat or sleep, and before forty days had passed, his girth had shrunk by some five

                            During that time, Abū Quraysh said nothing to Hārūn al-Rashīd, for fear he might inform his cousin of the physician’s design to implant fear in his heart and thereby bring the plan to naught. On the eve of the fortieth day, however, he told the caliph that he was quite sure that ʿĪsā ibn Jaʿfar had lost weight, and suggested that he should invite him to the palace, or else ride over to call on him. Accordingly, al-Rashīd mounted his horse and rode to his cousin’s house, where he found ʿĪsā with the physician. As soon as the caliph entered, ‘Īsā said to him, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, give me leave to kill this infidel, for he has killed me – look!’ and he wrapped his waistband around himself. ‘My enemy here, O Commander of the Faithful, has shrunk my waist by five

                            from sheer terror.’ At this, Hārūn al-Rashīd prostrated himself and thanked God, and then he said to ʿĪsā ibn Jaʿfar:

He called for a knife and cut a slice from one of them and gave it to me, saying ‘Eat this.’ I told him that Bukhtīshūʿ had forbidden me to so much as smell melons, but he retorted, ‘And that is why you have remained ill for so long. Eat it, it won’t hurt you!’ So I ate it, and found it delicious. He told me to go on eating, and so I did, until I had finished two of the melons. Then I felt that I could eat no more, but he cut a slice from the third melon and said, ‘What you have eaten so far has been for enjoyment, but this slice is therapeutic.’ I choked it down somehow, and then he cut yet another slice, at the same time making signs to the attendants that they should bring a basin, and said to me, ‘Eat this one as well.’ I had eaten less than a third of it when my gorge rose and I was overcome with a fit of vomiting, regurgitating not only the melon that I had eaten, but great quantities of yellow bile as well. I then fainted. Subsequently, I broke out in a heavy sweat and fell asleep until after the time of the noon prayer. When I awoke, I was so hungry that I was almost out of my mind, although previously I had had not the slightest desire for food. I shouted for something to eat, and the three chickens were brought to me; the meat had been prepared as a vinegar stew, and the cooks had done it to a turn. I ate my fill, and then slept again until the time of the afternoon prayer had passed. When I awoke, I rose from my bed. My illness had vanished, I had recovered. Nor has that illness returned since that time.

While the caliph slept, they would drink together. One day, when Ibn al-Lajlāj had drunk a good deal of date-wine and was feeling the effects of it, he asked Abū Sahl how much longer, in his opinion, al-Manṣūr was likely to live. In Ismāʿīl’s own words:

He kept this resolution for three days, but subsequently they became reconciled, and as they sat drinking date-wine together again as before, Ibn al-Lajlāj said to Abū Sahl, ‘I asked you what you thought about something, but you refused to answer and avoided my company. Listen now while I return good for evil. Al-Manṣūr is a man whose temperament is warm, and his body is drying out as he grows older. He had his head shaved in al-Ḥīrah,

Al-Manṣūr smiled, and then he said, ‘Your father has not been of much use! I propose to offer you a choice between two alternatives.’ ‘What are they, Sire?’ I enquired. ‘Either I take that rigmarole you just uttered and shorten it to “Ṭīmādh,” ’ he said, ‘or else I call you by a familiar name, let us say “Abū Sahl”, instead of using your real name.’ Abū Sahl told me that he liked the idea of being known by that name, so he adopted it and ceased to use his original name.</p>

The elderly retainer set off (we were in Hamadhān at the time), and as she went along she chanced to pass ʿĪsā Abū Quraysh’s tent. A number of slave-boys belonging to men of the army were standing there with phials of urine which they were showing to ʿĪsā, and she decided that she had better not go any further until he had seen the urine she was carrying. Upon scrutinizing it, he said to her, ‘This urine is that of a pregnant woman, and the child she is carrying is a boy.’ Al-Khayzurān’s serving-woman ran back to her mistress to relay this news. Upon hearing it, al-Khayzurān prostrated herself and gave thanks to God, and then manumitted a number of slaves; next, she went to al-Mahdī and told him what her retainer had said. The caliph was more delighted at the news than al-Khayzurān herself; he ordered ʿĪsā brought in and questioned him personally about the serving-woman’s message. When the apothecary confirmed that he had made no mistake, both caliph and al-Khayzurān rewarded him lavishly, and al-Mahdī ordered him to leave his tent and apothecary’s paraphernalia and enter his own service.

                                    Ṭayfūr, thinking to do me a favour, sent a message to al-Khayzurān. ‘My personal physician,’ it ran, ‘is skilled in the art of medicine. I suggest you send a sample of urine to him and have him look at it.’ Al-Khayzurān fell in with this suggestion, sending me a phial of her urine the following day. Ṭayfūr urged me to give the same diagnosis that ʿĪsā had given, but I told him that while the urine did indicate a pregnancy, I could not tell whether the child was male or female. He pressed me hard, but I would not agree, having no wish to acquire a reputation as a charlatan. Finally he reported my conclusion to al-Khayzurān, who awarded me a purse of one thousand dirhams and ordered me to join her retinue. The baby, al-Hādī, was born after she had reached Rayy. Al-Mahdī, for his part, had had ʿĪsā Abū Quraysh put to the test in every conceivable way, and had ascertained that he was impotent. This was good news for the caliph, and thereafter the apothecary stood higher in his favour than all his eunuchs. That was one reason why I myself obtained advancement, for I became the attendant of Mūsā,

Evidently his birth was al-Hādī’s misfortune, for the younger son now enjoyed all, or nearly all, his parents’ attention. It was a misfortune for me as well, as it cost me dearly in prestige and income, until Mūsā was older and could see how matters stood. That turn of events marked an improvement in my own fortunes, for he thought well of me and treated me with greater consideration than his mother, al-Khayzurān, had done.</p>

Mūsā al-Hādī allowed me to treat all his children as though they were my own, and he told Amat al-ʿAzīz that he was blessed, thanks to me. As a result, she treated me with greater generosity than I could have hoped for from al-Hādī himself.

                                    As caliph, al-Hādī determined to have his son, Jaʿfar ibn Mūsā, receive the oath of allegiance as his successor.

You are the most honourable of all mankind, having seen to the upbringing of a caliph’s son who became heir apparent, and that heir apparent then became caliph in the house of his son until the latter became heir apparent in his turn.’ Word of the investiture reached Amat al-ʿAzīz, and she responded in much the same way as al-Hādī, loading me with presents and having great quantities of clothing sent to my house; however, she did not present me with a horse. I remained in the palace in ʿĪsābādh

Even after most of his comrades had died, he was never appointed to replace any of them. Al-Hādī had had him summoned to attend the ceremony, and when his turn came, he was ordered to take the oath. ‘O Commander of the Faithful,’ he said, ‘to whom am I to swear fealty?’ ‘Swear to Jaʿfar, son of the Commander of the Faithful,’ replied al-Hādī. ‘My right hand is occupied with a declaration of fealty to the Commander of the Faithful,’ said Harthamah, ‘while my left is occupied with a declaration of fealty to Hārūn. Which hand am I to use to make my declaration?’ ‘You will declare Hārūn deposed and swear fealty to Jaʿfar,’ retorted the caliph, but Harthamah said:

By God, even if I thought you would have me burned alive for speaking the truth to you, that would not prevent me from doing so. This declaration of fealty, O Commander of the Faithful, is nothing more nor less than an oath. I have sworn fealty to Hārūn in the same words that you are now asking me to utter to swear fealty to Jaʿfar. If I declare Hārūn deposed today, perhaps I will declare Jaʿfar deposed tomorrow, and so with all those who had sworn fealty to Hārūn in that way and have now betrayed him.</p>

At this, Harthamah replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, I can only repeat what I have already said.’ Al-Hādī said angrily, ‘Be off with you, God curse you! May neither you nor your friends swear an oath of fealty for a thousand years.’ He ordered him escorted out of the ʿĪsābādh palace and stripped of his command. ‘Let him go wherever he wishes,’ said the caliph, ‘and may God not go with him or protect him.’ He then remained silent for half an hour or so, ordering none of the assembly either to do or not to do anything, then raised his head and said to his servant, Yandūn, ‘Catch up with the filthy swine!’ ‘Yes, Sire,’ was the reply, ‘and once I have caught up with him, what am I to do with him?’ ‘Bring him back to the Commander of the Faithful,’ said the caliph.

The people dispersed in a great state, such as might be felt by any man of importance who had been the cause of embarrassment to the caliph, compounded by apprehension about what they might expect if anything should befall al-Hādī, after they had so hastily proclaimed Hārūn al-Rashīd deposed. The faction that had supported Jaʿfar had been hoping that their man would become caliph, with wealth for themselves once he had been installed in office, and now it was beginning to look as though Jaʿfar himself might be killed and that his followers would be fortunate to escape death, persecution and poverty.

This morning we had high hopes for that youth, and now, this evening, we have good reason to fear for his life.’ ‘As you say,’ replied the caliph, ‘but I have one thing to add to that.’ ‘And what is it, O Commander of the Faithful?’ she asked. ‘When I ordered Harthamah brought back,’ he said, ‘I fully intended to have him executed. But when he was standing there, suddenly there was something that prevented me from proceeding: I found myself under a compulsion to give him a present and grant him some land. In addition, I intend to promote him in rank and speak favourably of him.’ Amat al-ʿAzīz thereupon burst into tears. ‘May God grant you joy!’ said al-Hādī, but she, together with all her entourage, imagined that he was intending to have Hārūn al-Rashīd assassinated by means of poison. However, he was not allowed the necessary time, for al-Hādī died only a few nights later. Hārūn al-Rashīd succeeded to the caliphate and by God he treated Jaʿfar’s mother most generously, while Jaʿfar himself received more benefits than ever, including marriage to Hārūn al-Rashīd’s own daughter, Umm Muḥammad.</p>

Now, Abū Ghānim was an excessively hot-blooded man, and would often hurt his friends’ feelings by making offensive remarks to them. Once, in Qubādir Zubayrūn,

                                    when I was a young man, I was in attendance upon Abū Ghānim, when al-Ṭayfūrī, the physician, came in, took his pulse, and examined his urine. He then said something to his patient in an undertone, so that I did not understand his words, but Abū Ghānim snarled, ‘Liar! Sucker of your mother’s clitoris!’

                                    Al-Ṭayfūrī retorted, ‘May God make whichever of us is lying bite his mother’s such and such.’ Listening, I thought to myself, ‘By God, al-Ṭayfūrī must be insane.’ ‘Your mother was an infidel!’ shouted Abū Ghānim. ‘Miserable wretch! How dare you speak to me like that?’ ‘By God,’ replied al-Ṭayfūrī, ‘I never permitted even my lord and master, al-Hādī, to speak a disrespectful word to me, and if ever he did, I would give back as good as I had got. How, then, shall I allow you, who are merely a dog, to fling insults at me?’ Abū Muslim swore to me that he saw his father laughing and weeping at the same time, his features indicating in part amusement, in part sadness. Then Abū Ghānim said to the physician, ‘By God! Really, you answered back when al-Hādī, the Commander of the Faithful, spoke rudely to you?’ ‘I did indeed,’ replied al-Ṭayfūrī. ‘But why, in God’s name,’ Abū Ghānim cried, ‘did you speak so disparagingly of Ḥumayd and abuse him as you did when I insulted you?’ and he wept bitterly for al-Hādī.

Of course, he had an army under his command, and that governed his professional conduct, but once he was with his brothers, it was as though he were one of themselves, rather than as one regarded as being superior to them.’</p>

Ḥumayd received them at a great gathering designed to show off the numbers of his troops, and he said to the leader, ‘What brings you here, my cousin?’ The leader replied, ‘I have come to provide you with reinforcements, since you are engaged in combat against one who claims that to which he is not entitled and which is not his.’ He was referring to our master. Ḥumayd replied, ‘I accept reinforcements only from those whom I know to be tough and stout of heart, and who can withstand such hard service as would be beyond the capacity of most men. I shall put you to the test. If you succeed, I shall accept you, but if you fail, you shall return to your tribe.’ ‘Try me as you will,’ said the Ṭāʾī leader, whereupon Ḥumayd brought out a heavy stick from under his prayer-carpet and said to the Ṭāʾī, ‘Hold out your arm.’ The man did so, and Ḥumayd lifted the stick up to his shoulder and brought it down, striking at the Ṭāʾī’s outstretched arm. At the last moment, however, the man drew his arm out of the way. ‘You evaded my stroke!’ said Ḥumayd angrily. The Ṭāʾī man muttered something placatory and invited Ḥumayd to repeat the trial. Again Ḥumayd told him to hold his arm out, again he did so, and again Ḥumayd brought the stick whistling down, and again the man drew his arm back at the last moment, so that the blow missed its target. At this, Ḥumayd had the man seized, taken from his assembly and thrown into prison. He then confiscated his riding animals and those of his companions and drove the men out of his camp, so off they trudged on foot, crestfallen and destitute.

I want you to look into the practice of every one of them, to determine which of them are honest professionals, men of integrity, and which are charlatans.’

There is nothing in alchemy.” “Indeed there is, O Commander of the Faithful,” Yūsuf replied, “but the art of alchemy is beset by a plague, and the name of that plague is ‘apothecaries’.” “Absurd!” said al-Maʾmūn, “whatever do you mean?” Yūsuf replied:</p>

The emissaries brought various things back to the caliph, in some cases a handful of seeds, in others, a fragment of stone, in still others a bit of fur. Al-Maʾmūn was so pleased with Yūsuf Laqwah’s frankness and honesty that he granted him some land on the canal known as the Nahr al-Kalbah. His descendants hold that land to this day, and live from the revenues that it yields. Now, if the emir should think fit, he might put these apothecaries to the test in the same way as al-Maʾmūn did.’

Some of them said they were not familiar with any such drugs, but others said they had them, took the emissary’s money and gave him something out of their stock. Al-Afshīn then had all the apothecaries brought before him, and when they were all assembled, he had licences issued to those who had said that they were not familiar with the names of the drugs his emissaries had asked for. Those apothecaries were allowed to remain in the camp, while all the others were ordered to leave. Not one of them was permitted to stay, and a crier was sent around to announce that any of them who was found in the camp might lawfully be killed. Finally, al-Afshīn wrote to the caliph al-Muʿtaṣim, asking him to send out a number of honest apothecaries and physicians. This pleased the caliph, and he sent al-Afshīn some apothecaries and physicians as he had requested.’

                            He was a distinguished practitioner of the art of medicine, and was well regarded by caliphs and kings, who showed him great respect. His position as al-Fatḥ ibn Khāqān’s medical attendant brought him a generous salary and ample benefits. The caliph al-Mutawakkil bi-Allāh had great faith in his judgement and consulted him regularly; his position in the caliph’s entourage was unassailable.

We read in that work that Isrāʾīl ibn Zakariyyā ibn al-Ṭayfūrī became furious with al-Mutawakkil, the Commander of the Faithful, when the caliph had had himself bled without Isrāʾīl’s approval. Al-Mutawakkil was able to appease his offended physician with a purse of three thousand dinars and the grant of an estate that yielded him fifty thousand dirhams a year. The caliph had a formal title issued to confirm the grant.

I therefore called on Thumāmah, taking with me my own physician, Yazīd. When I entered the room, I saw a man who appeared to have no more than a breath or two left in his body; I did not think that I could ask him any questions. My physician, Yazīd, had the attending physician sent for. When he appeared, Yazīd asked him about the case. The attending physician replied that the patient went to stool a hundred times in the course of a day and a night. Yazīd then proceeded to question him in detail about the medicines Thumāmah had taken and about the medicinal powders and enemas that had been administered to him. The physician listed them all, adding in every case that it had been tried and had had no effect. Yazīd lowered his head in thought for the space of an hour or so. He then looked up and said, ‘There is one further possibility, which I hope will be of use. If it does not help, there will be nothing that we can do.’

                                    replied Yazīd. ‘I should like to see and smell this digestive,’ said the sick man, whereupon Yazīd took from his sleeve a handkerchief containing various drugs, including the potion he had called a digestive. ‘Untie it, would you?’ said Thumāmah, and when Yazīd untied it, Thumāmah seized the digestive, threw it into his mouth and swallowed it. By God, hardly had it gone down when I heard such sounds that I was sure he would be dead by the time I had reached the door of his house. I arose, along with my physician, well-nigh out of my mind with sorrow, and told a slave-boy, whom I had brought along to carry my astrolabe while I rode, to remain in the house and send me word of Thumāmah when there should be any news. I received a message from him the next afternoon: Thumāmah, he said, had gone to the latrine fifty times between sunrise and noon. When I read that, I said to myself, ‘By God, he is a dead man.’ A second message arrived that evening, informing me that between noon and sunset, Thumāmah had gone to the latrine twenty times. In the morning, however, the boy himself turned up and reported that between sunset and midnight, the patient had gone to the latrine only three times, and between midnight and dawn, not at all.

                                    Accordingly, after performing the dawn prayer, I rode to Thumāmah’s house, where I found him sleeping, something he had been unable to do for some time. When he awoke and greeted me, I asked him how he was, and he informed me that because of pain in his abdomen, he had had no sleep or repose for more than forty nights. When he had swallowed the digestive, however, and its initial impact had passed, the pain had disappeared. Moreover, he had had no desire for any food during all that time, whereas at present he could hardly see me, so hungry was he. He asked Yazīd whether it would be all right for him to eat. Yazīd told him he might eat a stew made from a fat young Kaskarī chicken,

                                            ‘Chyme’ nowadays means the semifluid mass of partly digested food that passes from the stomach into the intestines during the process of digestion. The Greek word χυμός from which both the English ‘chyme’ and the Arabic

That corrupted food and medicine then became matter for further corruption, and consequently, the malady became progressively worse. I knew that the patient’s only hope was a strong medicine that could overcome the action of the chyme, and the strongest medicine that he could take was a digestive. I therefore suggested it to him, taking care, mind you, not to tell him that the draught would cure him. No indeed, I merely said that there remained one further possibility, and that if it did not help, there would be nothing more that we could do. I chose those words because I saw that the patient’s strength had been seriously sapped by his illness and was nearly gone. I could not be sure that he would not die if he drank it; I hoped it would cure him, but in any case it was clear that he would die if he did

Therein lay a great blessing from God.’</p>

                                    This story resembles one that is related of the Messenger of God, may God bless and keep him. A man of the Arabs is said to have come to him and said to him, ‘O Messenger of God, my brother is suffering from a grievous stomach ailment. We have treated him, but without effect.’ The Messenger of God, may God bless and keep him, said, ‘Give him bee-honey.’ The man returned and fed the patient honey, but the diarrhoea became worse. The tribesman went back to Muḥammad and said, ‘O Messenger of God, his diarrhoea has worsened since I gave him the honey.’ ‘Give him honey,’ repeated Muḥammad. The man gave his brother more honey, only to find that the diarrhoea became still worse. He went back to the Messenger of God, may God bless and keep him, to complain, but Muḥammad replied, ‘Give him yet more honey.’ The man did so for the third straight day, and this time the diarrhoea dwindled and finally dried up altogether. When he reported this outcome to the Messenger of God, may God bless and keep him, he said, ‘You see? God spoke the truth, and your brother’s stomach lied.’

                                    The reason why the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said that to the man was that he knew that the velvety lining of a sick person’s stomach contains certain thick, viscid humours that make the stomach slick, with the result that any binding medication that he takes passes right through without effect, while the humours remain there. Food also slides through, and consequently the diarrhoea continues. When the patient takes honey, the honey dislodges those humours and drives them downward. This causes the diarrhoea to increase at first, as the humours are evacuated, but ultimately they are entirely eliminated, the diarrhoea dries up, and the patient recovers.

                            When al-Qāsim had drunk it, the pain left him; he went twice to the latrine, and it was apparent that his condition had improved. The next morning, the physician gave him some barley water and received his patient’s compliments in return.

                        <p>Abū ʿAlī al-Qiyānī also reports that his brother, Isḥāq ibn ʿAlī, once became ill with a high fever. He wasted away until he had become so weak that he could eat nothing. In the month of June, ʿAbdūs ibn Zayd dosed him with that same decoction of roots with the electuary and castor oil in it for twenty-four days running, and by the end of that time he had recovered, with his stomach comfortably settled. The physician said to him, ‘At about this time next year, you will be stricken with a high fever which you may not survive, but if you do, I will save you, with God’s permission, exalted is He. The sign of the restoration of your health in the course of the year will be that your nature will take an upward turn on the seventh day. If that happens, you will recover. At the same time, however, your stomach will become so empty that if you were to put a stone into it, it would grind the stone.’</p>
                        <p>‘A year later,’ al-Qiyānī’s account continues, ‘it was ‘Abdūs who fell ill, while on that very day my brother came down with fever, just as the physician had foretold. From his sickbed, ʿAbdūs displayed constant concern for my brother, asking frequently for news of him. Finally he was informed that my brother’s nature had taken an upward turn. “He is saved,” he sighed, and died the next morning.’</p>

                            Sahl came from al-Ahwāz, and spoke with the characteristic accent of Khūzistān. He was heavily bearded; his nickname ‘al-Kawsaj’, which means ‘beardless’, was some sort of joke. He was knowledgeable about the art of medicine, albeit less learned than his son. Sahl was a great joker, rather to the detriment of his gravitas. He was not comparable to Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh,

                            tells the story of one of Sahl al-Kawsaj’s merry pranks. In the year 209/824, under the pretext that he was ill, he sent for witnesses and asked them to witness his will, which he wrote out then and there. In it, he listed the names of his children as, first, Jūrjis ibn Mīkhāʾīl, whose mother was Maryam bint Bukhtīshūʿ, Jibrīl’s sister; second, Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh, and third, fourth and fifth, Sābūr, Yūḥannā and Khudhāwayh, who were known to be his offspring. He stated that he had seduced the mothers of Jūrjis and Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh, getting them pregnant with Jūrjis and Yūḥannā respectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another anecdote related by Yūsuf runs as follows:</p>

                            <quote>
                                <p>
                                    Once, when I had called on Aʿyan ibn Harthamah ibn Aʿyan, I found Sahl there. He and Jūrjis were shouting abuse at each other, arguing about a quartan fever from which Aʿyan had been suffering for some time, and Sahl told Jūrjis the same tale that he had spun in the matter of the will that he had had witnessed. Jūrjis turned repeatedly toward those who were to the left of him and then toward those on his right, speechless with fury. At this, Sahl cried, ‘Anaphylactic feet, by the tooth of the Masai! Re-shite the Tone-purse into his ear,’ by which he meant, ‘An epileptic fit, by the truth of the Messiah! Recite the Throne-verse into his ear.’

                                            This is presumably an attempt to reproduce Sahl’s characteristic Khūzistān accent. The Throne-verse is verse 255 of the second surah of the Qur’an (al-Baqarah). The fun is based on Sahl’s mispronunciation of certain consonants, e.g.

                                    lived and the other places where Christians go on Palm Sunday. As he went along, he chanced to see Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh, and observed that he was better dressed than he himself was and was riding a more spirited horse. In addition, he was attended by a number of handsome-looking slave-boys. Sahl felt a pang of envy at this display of prosperity. He went to the captain of the district constabulary and said to him, ‘My son is disobedient and conceited. Indeed, he is so self-important and proud that he may have disowned me as his father. There are twenty dinars in it for you if you will throw him to the ground and give him twenty good, hard lashes,’ and he took out the twenty dinars then and there. Handing the money to a man whom the captain knew and trusted, he then withdrew a short distance away. When Yūḥannā came by, Sahl said to the captain, ‘There he is, that’s my disobedient son, who thinks he’s better than I am.’ Yūḥannā protested that he was no son of Sahl’s, but the captain spoke not a word: he threw him to the ground and flogged him, administering twenty stinging lashes.

He was born, so I have been told, in the year 129/746, and he died in 222/837. Abū Isḥāq

For Kufa is the stronghold of the adversary against whom you are about to take the field, and if your army is routed, it is certain that none of your family who remain here will survive, whereas if it is you who defeat the enemy and strike down the man who is currently the cynosure of every eye, your success will make the people hate you all the more. You yourself may escape with your life, but assuredly your descendants will not be so fortunate once you are gone.’ ‘I really can’t do that,’ replied ʿĪsā, ‘for the Commander of the Faithful will not be leaving Kufa,

He did so, but al-Manṣūr refused, saying that he had decided to appoint him governor of Kufa. When ʿĪsā reported this to Furāt, the physician replied, ‘If he is appointing you governor of Kufa, he does not mean you to continue to be the heir apparent, for if that were his intention, he would have appointed you governor of Khorasan, which is the land of your faction.

The people of the two Jazīrahs and Syria, for their part, do not favour the Umayyads out of genuine feeling, but only because the Umayyads treated them generously.

                                    I have heard from Mūsā ibn Isrāʾīl, the physician, that ʿĪsā ibn Mūsā once complained to his own physician, Furāt, that in the course of social evenings, he would frequently become sleepy. If he took his supper with his companions, his stomach became heavy, and he would nod off and sleep through the evening’s conversation, and then the next morning he would feel very full and did not want any breakfast. On the other hand, if he did not take supper with the others, he would feel terrible pangs of hunger. ‘What you have just said to me,’ the physician replied, ‘is exactly what al-Ḥajjāj

Tayādhūq gave him advice that was meant to be beneficial but turned out in the event to be harmful instead.’ ‘What was it?’ enquired ‘Īsā. ‘He advised him to snack on pistachios,’ replied Furāt. ‘Al-Ḥajjāj reported this to the women of his harem, and every single one of them had a quantity of pistachios shelled and a bowlful of them sent to him. All through his social evening with his companions, al-Ḥajjāj was gulping those pistachios, and as a result he was stricken with a bout of diarrhoea with vomiting

By that I meant that you should take a handful of unshelled pistachios and crack them yourself one by one, for having the shells in your mouth would have been beneficial for the stomach of a bilious youth like yourself, while the taste of them would have made its way to your liver, which would thereby have benefited as well. Then you would have proceeded to eat the kernel and tried to crack another one, but before you had finished doing so, nature would have ensured that you had digested the previous one. Eating them as you did, it is not surprising that you are worse off now than you were before.’ ‘And,’ Mūsā concluded, ‘if you, O emir, will eat pistachios as my teacher said they should be eaten, they are sure to do you good.’

Abū Nuwās was in the habit of setting out from Basra every day, and whenever he met anyone coming from the direction of Ḥakamān, he would ask the person for news of Janān.

                        <p>The following account is also taken from Yūsuf ibn Ibrāhīm, again quoting Ayyūb ibn al-Ḥakam.</p>
                        <p>Ayyūb tells how he was once sitting with Māsarjawayh as he examined phials of urine, when a Khūzistānī man came up to him and said, ‘I am suffering from an illness unlike any that anyone has ever suffered from before.’ Māsarjawayh asked him about it, and he said, ‘In the morning, I find I cannot see clearly, and I have a feeling in my stomach, it is as though it were being devoured by dogs, until I have something to eat. Once I have had some breakfast, these symptoms disappear, but then they recur at midday. I then again have something to eat, and this eases the symptoms, but they return at the time of the evening prayer. The only way of treating my condition that I have found is to eat at intervals.’ ‘The wrath of God upon that illness,’ cried Māsarjawayh. ‘God made an unfortunate decision in giving it to such a worthless person as yourself. Would that it were to fall upon me and my children instead! I would be willing to give you half of everything I own in exchange for it.’ ‘Whatever do you mean?’ asked the man. ‘That illness is known as health,’ explained Māsarjawayh, ‘and you do not deserve it; I ask God to transfer it to some more meritorious person.’</p>

I went back to Māsarjawayh and told him about it. Without saying a word to me, he administered an enema consisting largely of fats, resins, marshmallow and Persian rice. Then he said, ‘You might have killed yourself by eating all those cucumbers with nothing in your stomach. They were sending yellow bile down your intestinal tract, and it was stripping away the humours that adhere to the intestines and prevent yellow bile from abrading them or causing dysentery (

                            Salmawayh was the personal physician of the caliph Abū Isḥāq Muḥammad al-Muʿtaṣim bi-Allāh.

                            He was appointed upon al-Muʿtaṣim’s accession in the year 218/833, and the new caliph treated him with such generosity that words are inadequate to describe it. When decrees from al-Muʿtaṣim relating to appointments and other matters came in to the relevant administrative departments, they would be in Salmawayh’s handwriting. Orders and decrees relating to princes and military captains were issued as being from the presence of the Commander of the Faithful, but they would be in Salmawayh’s handwriting.

                        <p>Salmawayh’s brother, Ibrāhīm ibn Bunān, for his part, was appointed head of local offices of the Treasury in the cities of the realm, his seal being affixed beside that of the Commander of the Faithful. In al-Muʿtaṣim’s estimation, those two outranked all others. Salmawayh was a sincere Christian. He performed many good works, led an exemplary life, and was a man of great intelligence and good judgement.</p>

The chief justice issues judgements about my property, whereas my physician issues judgements about my life, and my life is more important to me than my possessions and my realm.’

                                <p>Salmawayh was more knowledgeable about the art of medicine than any of his contemporaries. Al-Muʿtaṣim was wont to address him as ‘My father’. When the physician was ill, the caliph went to visit him, and said to him in tears, ‘Give me some advice that will be useful to me once you have left me.’ ‘You have treated me with the utmost kindness, Sire,’ replied Salmawayh. ‘Beware of that mountebank Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh. When you consult him about some complaint, he is likely to prescribe a number of remedies; if so, take the one that contains the fewest ingredients.’ When Salmawayh died, al-Muʿtaṣim refused to take any food on the day of his death. He ordered that the physician’s bier should be carried to the caliphal palace, and there the full Christian rites performed, complete with prayers, candles and incense. The caliph was present throughout, demonstrating to the highest degree his esteem for Salmawayh. He mourned him sadly.</p>
                                <p>Al-Muʿtaṣim was blessed with a good digestion. Salmawayh had bled him regularly twice a year, administering a laxative afterward, and had put him on a diet from time to time. Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh, however, wishing to show the caliph something to which he was not accustomed, administered the laxative before bleeding him, explaining, ‘I am afraid that your yellow bile will become agitated.’ But when his patron took the laxative, his blood became fevered and his temperature rose; he lost flesh, fell prey to a growing array of disorders, wasted away and finally died, twenty months after Salmawayh.</p>

Now, I have been thinking about your situation, and it is clear to me that not a day should go by without my receiving news of you and being informed of what you require for your welfare. To that end, I must designate a servant expressly for the purpose of informing me of your needs. I have thought of two possible candidates. Both of them attend my working meetings and my soirées; indeed, they have access to my presence even in the bedchamber and during my ritual ablutions. Their names are Masrūr Samānah the eunuch

                                    Once Abū Isḥāq had introduced me to Salmawayh, the time soon came when we were nearly inseparable. The Commander of the Faithful’s departure from Baghdad turned out to be his last. There had been no announcement beforehand that he was setting out for somewhere in particular. However, the people, including some of the Christian clergy, had gathered at the carriage gate to admire the saddle-trappings. The day was Wednesday, seventeen nights having elapsed in the month of Dhū l-Qaʿdah of the year 220 [1 November 835]. The horses were led out. Al-Muʿtaṣim then had the

Have you ever heard the like? I wonder what the attraction is. After all, the terrain here is rough and hummocky everywhere, there are numerous hills, and the heat is intense where the stony ground has been baked by the sun. Surely no one would settle here unless he was under compulsion and had no choice, or else was not very particular.” ’

The thought crossed my mind that he had detected something unfriendly in al-Muʿtaṣim’s behaviour toward him.

Let me hear it again, would you, and tell me which king it was who said it.’ ‘It was Anūshirwān,’

This prince of ours (meaning al-Wāthiq) has a very retentive memory: he retains everything that he reads, and he has more books read to him than his reason can accommodate. In my view, he has fallen into a bad situation, and I pray God will deliver him from evil.’ His eyes filled with tears. I asked him why he was weeping, and he said, ‘I advised the Commander of the Faithful not to do any drinking last night, because he was to undergo a cupping today, and I wanted him to be in a clean condition when he got up.

I was also afraid that his father would adopt the principle set forth in Ardashīr ibn Bābak’s
                                    <hi rend="italic">Testament</hi>
                                    to the effect that there should be no public proclamation of allegiance to the heir apparent. In addition, I was afraid for him on the grounds of what Ardāshīr says in the matter of the people’s preference for the heir apparent once they are aware of his position, and also because of what Ardāshīr says concerning the risk that the heir apparent may be resented for what his father has done once it becomes known that he is to succeed the latter. By God! I knew, you see, that even a trace of any of this would make his life burdensome, and also that there would never be any proclamation of allegiance to him. That is why I am distressed.’ In the event, it all came about just as Salmawayh had feared.

Accordingly, he drafted a letter giving vent to his feelings, gave it to me, and told me to read it to Salmawayh and see what he thought of it. If he deemed it suitable, I should seal it and send it to the caliph, but if the physician regarded the letter as unsatisfactory, I should bring it back. Accordingly, I read it to Salmawayh.

You are as favourably placed as heart could wish; you have surpassed the dead, now rival the living! You have been fortunate to the point that you need have no fear of a reversal, and consequently it is inappropriate for you to take umbrage if the caliph slights you because one of your enemies has said something slanderous to him about you, so that he is cross with you for two or three days or so. He will soon recall the importance of family ties and relent, and then your situation will be as satisfactory as ever. There is also a sword of Damocles hanging over you, for which you must be on your guard: it is that you sit with the caliph in his working meetings and soirées with members of his household, his captains, and his leading clients, where he is naturally the object of their eyes and the hope of their hearts. In those meetings and soirées, not a word must escape your lips that does not unequivocally express your support for him. If you were like Ibn Abī Dāʾūd [Duʾād]

                                    On one occasion, Salmawayh and I were talking about Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh. I went on at length about him, saying that I knew how learned he was. ‘Yūḥannā is a catastrophe for anyone who consults him,’ retorted Salmawayh, ‘and for anyone who relies on his treatment, his extensive book-knowledge, his elegant explanations and misleading descriptions of his patients’ morbid conditions. The beginning of medicine,’ he lectured me, ‘is a knowledge of the scope of the disorder, so that a judicious treatment can be applied, and Yūḥannā is the most ignorant of all God’s creation both as regards the assessment of an illness and as regards the determination of an appropriate treatment. If his patient is feverish, he treats him with cold medicines and excessively cooling foods in an attempt to drive down his temperature, with the result that the patient’s stomach and body become chilled and must be treated with
                                    <hi rend="italic">warming</hi>
                                    medicines and foods. Yūḥannā then proceeds in the same way as he did before, taking excessive measures to counteract the chill, and consequently the patient becomes ill from overheating. In short, his patient is always ill from being either chilled or overheated, and that weakens the body. People consult physicians in order to preserve their health while they are healthy and to help restore Nature when they are ill, and Yūḥannā cannot serve either of those functions, owing to his inability to gauge disease and remedy alike correctly. Such a person cannot call himself a physician.’

                                    in the Baghdad, when Muḥammad al-Amīn was caliph, he remarked, ‘It was a benefit from God, in those days, that we lived not far from Bishr and Bashīr ibn al-Samaydaʿ,

                                            Bishr ibn al-Samaydaʿ al-Azdī was the governor of Balad, a city on the Tigris (Ṭabarī,

                                            (ed. Leiden), iii:779); Bashīr was, presumably, his brother.

                                    for with them we were quite safe.’ Then he said to me, ‘Would you care to ride over to Bashīr’s house and visit him? I had despaired of him the day before yesterday, but by yesterday he had recovered.’ I replied that I should be happy to accompany him, and we rode off to see Bashīr. When we had reached the gate of the street in which he lived, we met the physician Būlus ibn Ḥanūn, who is now the physician of the people of Palestine, coming from Bashīr’s house. Salmawayh asked him how Bashīr was doing, and he answered with a word in Syriac meaning ‘he is in a bad way.’ ‘Surely you told me only yesterday that he was better?’ said Salmawayh. ‘Yes,’ replied the other, ‘but that was then; last night he ate a dish of kid brains, and suffered a recurrence of the diarrhoea.’ At this, Salmawayh turned his mount and said, ‘Let us go; Bashīr will not last the night.’ ‘How so?’ I asked, and he explained that Bashīr was subject to stomach ailments. ‘His illness began in his stomach,’ he said, ‘and after many days the disorder has spread to his liver. Now the dish of brains that he has eaten will remain in his stomach and cause everything within it to coagulate, with the result that any food or medicine that he takes will pass through without effect.’ Accordingly, Salmawayh and I went our way without visiting Bashīr, and he was dead before the night was out.

I stayed with him for ten months, and in all that time I do not recall a single day that I spent doing the work that I was supposed to be doing. A messenger arrived one day suggesting that I should attend one of the soirées and pay attention to the different views expressed by the physicians.

                                    and most of them are destitute. What if you had to put one of them to the question at the residence? Would you be safe? I fear not, for if something should happen to your master, you would be in an alien land, a captive in the hands of people who were not of your kind. Conversely, to refuse to go after having agreed to do so would not be proper. But ask him to grant you a delay of seven days before your departure, and use that time to keep track of everything he eats and drinks. He should ingest nothing whatever during that time without your being aware of how much it weighs, precisely. Designate someone to weigh all the solid material and urine that comes out of him during that week, day by day, and forward the results to you. Then, at the end of the week, come to me with the weights of all the food, drink and other things that he has taken in and the weight of everything that he has put out.’

When I informed Salmawayh of this, he said, ‘If the weight of what came out had been equal to the weight of what went in, that would have shown that he was not long for this world. How then when the weight of the output was double the weight of the intake? He is a dead man.’ And indeed, a mere ten days or so after this conversation, Abū Dulaf was dead.</p>

                                    My grandfather, al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAbd Allāh, and Salmawayh the physician were good friends. My grandfather told me that he had called on Salmawayh at his home on one occasion when he was in the bath. He then emerged, bundled up in clothing and with sweat running down his brow. A servant came to meet him, carrying a small table laden with a roast francolin, some green stuff in a cream-coloured porcelain bowl, three loaves of flatbread, some tamarisk fruits, and some vinegar in a plate. He ate it all, and then called for a quantity of wine amounting to about two dirhams, which he mixed and drank. Finally he washed his hands with water, and then he proceeded to change his clothes, which he perfumed with incense. When he had finished doing all this, he began to speak to me, but I said, ‘Before answering that, I want you to tell me what it is that you have just done.’ ‘I have been treating myself for consumption

Upon emerging from my bath, I need to take action to neutralize the heat, as otherwise it would act upon my body and deprive it of some of its humours. Accordingly, I use food to divert it.

                                    When one of these fish was caught, its head and body down to the vent were coated with clay. Someone then gripped the fish with his hands and held the uncoated part over hot coals and roasted it until it was done to a turn. It was then eaten, or discarded, while the fish was thrown back into the water. Provided its backbone had not been broken, the fish would live and grow new flesh on its bones. Upon hearing this story, Ghassān had a pond dug in his grounds and filled with water and ordered the matter put to the test.

The former would die, but the latter would not: the flesh grew back and the skin was renewed. However, whereas the original skin of those fish resembles that of a black kid, the new skin of the specimens that we had subjected to our experiments, roasting and removing some of their flesh and then returning them to the water, was more of a whitish colour.</p>

                        <p>Ayyūb, known as ‘al-Abrash’, was well versed in the art of medicine. He also understood the principles of translation, having translated a number of Greek works into Syriac and Arabic. Most of his translations are unimpressive. Toward the end of his life, however, he produced some that are of higher quality than his earlier efforts.</p>

                                    suggested to al-Mutawakkil that he should give the physician a present. ‘Why not give him one yourself?’ said the caliph. ‘Whatever you give him, I shall match it.’ Qabīḥah promptly ordered a purse of dirhams to be brought for Ibrāhīm. The caliph did the same. Qabīḥah then ordered another purse, and again the caliph followed suit. They continued in this fashion until sixteen purses were heaped about Ibrāhīm’s feet. At that point, Qabīḥah made a sign to her maid to stop bringing them. ‘Don’t stop,’ Ibrāhīm said to her, ‘I’ll give them back to you.’ ‘Take what God has granted you,’ she replied, ‘I can see that you will never be satisfied.’ ‘By God,’ interposed al-Mutawakkil, ‘if you had continued until the morning, I would have continued to match whatever you had given.’ In the event, the purses were delivered to Ibrāhīm’s house.

                            He was the first to attend the caliph every day: as soon as he had performed his morning prayer, Jibrīl would cleanse his eyelids and apply collyrium to his eyes, and he did the same when al-Maʾmūn awoke from his afternoon siesta. For these services, he was paid a thousand dirhams every month.

One day, however, Yāsir happened to be passing the door of the room where the caliph was just as Jibrīl was coming out after having refreshed al-Maʾmūn’s eyelids and applied collyrium to his eyes. Yāsir asked after the caliph, and Jibrīl replied that he was having a nap. Yāsir took advantage of the opportunity to slip away and visit his ailing brother while al-Maʾmūn was asleep. But the caliph awoke before Yāsir had returned, and when he did return, al-Maʾmūn asked him why he was late. ‘I had been informed that you were sleeping, Sire,’ explained Yāsir, ‘so I went to visit my brother, al-Ḥusayn.’ ‘Who told you that I was sleeping?’ asked the caliph, and Yāsir replied that it had been Jibrīl, the eye care attendant.

                                <p>Māsawayh Abū Yūḥannā was a trainee at the Gondēshāpūr hospital for thirty years. When he heard of Jibrīl’s appointment as personal physician to the caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd, he said, ‘Here Abū ʿĪsā [Jibrīl] has risen to the stars, while we here at the hospital are never going to get any further.’ Jibrīl was responsible for the hospital, and when he heard of the younger man’s remark he had Māsawayh dismissed and turned out and his salary discontinued. Finding himself without resources, Māsawayh went to Baghdad, intending to grovel and offer his apologies to Jibrīl. He haunted the physician’s door incessantly, but was never invited to enter; when Jibrīl rode by, Māsawayh would utter blessings upon him and implore his pity, but the great man never spoke to him.</p>

                                <p>It so happened that a eunuch in the employ of al-Faḍl ibn al-Rabīʿ came to be afflicted with an eye complaint. Jibrīl summoned oculists to treat him, and they plied him with various remedies, but to no avail: his pain grew worse and worse, so that he was unable to sleep. One morning, as he emerged from the palace, sleepless and suffering, half out of his mind with pain and in a foul temper, he caught sight of Māsawayh and shouted at him, ‘What are you doing here, O shaykh? If you are any good at your trade, make me better; otherwise, be off with you!’ ‘I am good at my trade, sir,’ replied Māsawayh, ‘second to none.’ ‘Come inside with me, then,’ said the eunuch, ‘and you can treat this eye of mine.’ Māsawayh accompanied him into the palace, and there he everted the man’s eyelid and applied collyrium to it, dripped one kind of medication on to his head, and made him sniff another. The patient became calm and fell asleep. The next morning, he sent Māsawayh a bowl with a loaf of fine bread, a kid, a chicken, sweetmeats, and a number of dinars and dirhams in it, together with a message: ‘This is to be your daily allowance. The dirhams and dinars are to be your monthly stipend from me.’ Māsawayh was so overcome that tears came into his eyes. The messenger, however, thought that he was weeping because he did not consider his reward adequate, and said to him consolingly, ‘Oh, don’t worry, he’ll give you more than that, he’ll treat you generously.’ ‘Not at all,’ replied Māsawayh, ‘I shall be quite content with this, if he provides it every day.’ The messenger went back into the palace and informed the eunuch of this exchange, much to the surprise of the latter as his eye recovered under the physician’s care.</p>

                                    Only a few days later, it was al-Faḍl himself who was suffering from an eye complaint. Jibrīl summoned oculists to treat him, and they dosed him with a number of remedies, but without effect. Then one night the eunuch smuggled Māsawayh into the palace. He applied collyrium to the vizier’s eye for a third of the night, then gave him a purgative. After this treatment, al-Faḍl felt better. When Jibrīl came in the next day, the vizier said to him, ‘Do you know, Abū ʿĪsā, there is a man here named Māsawayh who is the most skilful and knowledgeable oculist you can imagine.’ ‘Who is it?’ asked Jibrīl, ‘you don’t mean the fellow who has been sitting outside the gate there?’ ‘The very man,’ said al-Faḍl. ‘I know him,’ sneered Jibrīl, ‘I used to give him menial tasks to do,

                                    but he proved useless, so I gave him the sack. And now he has presumed to set up as a physician, he who has never practised medicine in his life! If you agree, may I suggest that you summon him while I am here.’ Jibrīl imagined that when Māsawayh came in he would remain standing and behave respectfully in his presence, but when al-Faḍl sent for him he entered, greeted the company, and sat down facing Jibrīl, quite at his ease. ‘Turned physician, then, have we, Māsawayh?’ said Jibrīl. ‘I have never ceased to be a physician,’ replied Māsawayh calmly, ‘for I have served at the hospital for thirty years. And you presume to speak to me in such terms!’ Jibrīl, alarmed at the possibility that the younger man might go on to say more, made haste to take his leave, greatly disconcerted.

                                <p>Al-Faḍl then gave orders that Māsawayh was to be paid a monthly salary of six hundred dirhams and fodder for two horses, and that accommodation for five slave-boys should be placed at his disposal. The vizier also ordered him to bring his family from Gondēshāpūr, giving him an ample sum of money to cover the cost of the move. Accordingly, he brought his household to Baghdad. His son Yūḥannā was very young at the time.</p>

                                    Shortly thereafter, it was the turn of Hārūn al-Rashīd to suffer from a painful eye complaint. ‘O Commander of the Faithful,’ said al-Faḍl to his master, ‘my physician, Māsawayh, is as skilled an oculist as anyone could imagine,’ and he told the caliph the whole story of his eunuch’s and his own experiences. ‘Have him brought in,’ said al-Rashīd, and the vizier had Māsawayh sent for. When he appeared, the caliph asked him whether he knew anything about medicine besides the treatment of eyes. ‘Indeed I do, O Commander of the Faithful,’ Māsawayh replied, ‘it would hardly be possible for me not to, since I have served the patients at the hospital for the past thirty years.’ The caliph bade him approach, and Māsawayh looked at his eyes. ‘What we want just now is a cupper,’ he said. After al-Rashīd’s legs had been cupped, Māsawayh dripped medication into his eyes, and two days later the caliph was better. He ordered that the physician should be paid a stipend of two thousand dirhams a month, together with twenty thousand dirhams a year for incidental expenses, fodder for his mounts, and accommodation. Māsawayh joined Jibrīl and the other physicians as a member of the caliph’s medical staff. At that time he was on a footing of equality with Jibrīl as far as attendance on the caliph went; Jibrīl, however, was wealthier, for he enjoyed a stipend of ten thousand dirhams monthly and a hundred thousand dirhams yearly for incidentals, besides frequent gifts and estates in fee.

                                <p>After a time, a sister of Hārūn al-Rashīd’s, named Bānū, became ill. Jibrīl subjected her to a variety of treatments, but her condition did not improve, much to the caliph’s distress. One day, al-Rashīd reflected that he remembered having heard Māsawayh say that he had served the patients at the hospital and knew how to treat various conditions. Resolving to bring him in to treat his sister in the hope that she would find relief at his hands, he sent for both Jibrīl and Māsawayh. Māsawayh asked his colleague to describe the lady’s illness and how he had been treating her, and Jibrīl gave him a full account. ‘I should say you have managed the case correctly and applied appropriate treatments,’ said Māsawayh, ‘but I must see her myself.’ Accordingly, the caliph ordered that both of them should be admitted to her presence. Māsawayh, accompanied by al-Rashīd and Jibrīl, entered the chamber where Bānū was lying, looked at her attentively, and took her pulse.</p>
                                <p>The three of them then left her, and once they were out of the room, Māsawayh said to the caliph, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, may God grant you long life, this woman is going to die the day after tomorrow, some time between three hours after sunset and midnight.’ ‘He is wrong, O Commander of the Faithful,’ exclaimed Jibrīl, ‘she will recover and live.’ At this, Hārūn al-Rashīd gave orders that Māsawayh should be confined to an apartment in the palace. ‘I intend to get to the bottom of this,’ he said, ‘and so I have put him on notice, for I have never had cause to doubt my head physician’s knowledge.’ But when the time came that Māsawayh had named, the princess died. After her funeral, Hārūn al-Rashīd’s first concern was to have Māsawayh sent for. He questioned the physician and was filled with admiration at his answers. His native language was Persian, but his judgement in the matter of the treatment of disease was sound, and he possessed extensive experience. Accordingly, the caliph promoted him to a position of equality with Jibrīl in respect of salary, accommodation, fodder and standing, and he also took an interest in the physician’s son, Yūḥannā: he spared no expenditure for the young man’s benefit, with the result that in due course he won distinction and renown.</p>

                                <p>Yūḥannā asked me whether I had seen Jibrīl lately, and I replied that the last time I had seen him had been the time when we had all been together in al-ʿAlth. Then I added, ‘He had heard a vile report about you.’ ‘What was that?’ he asked, and so I told him what Jibrīl had said, that he had heard that Yūḥannā claimed to know more about the art of medicine than Galen himself. ‘May God curse the slanderer who said such a thing about me,’ he exclaimed, ‘for whoever he was, he spoke falsely and unscrupulously.’ This relieved the anxiety I had been feeling, and I told Yūḥannā that I would pass his assurance on to Jibrīl and thereby relieve him as well from the distress that the original report had caused him. ‘I beg you to do so,’ he replied, ‘and tell him this, which is what I actually said, rather than the distorted version that he heard.’ ‘Well?’ I said. ‘All I said,’ he answered, ‘was that, had Hippocrates and Galen lived to hear what I have to say about the art of medicine, they would have prayed to their Lord for all their other senses, sight, smell, taste and touch, to be transmuted into the sense of hearing and added to their original sense of hearing, the better to attend to my wisdom and magisterial exposition. Now, I adjure you by God, tell him that directly from me.’ I implored him not to make me do it, but he insisted.</p>

                                    Accordingly, I told Jibrīl what Yūḥannā had said. Jibrīl had left his sickbed that very morning, his health restored, but the message I had brought him made him so full of anger and displeasure that I was really in fear of a relapse. He began to curse himself. ‘This,’ he shouted, ‘is what comes of bestowing a benefit where it was not deserved! This is what comes of providing support and guidance for a base individual, and giving access to the noble art of medicine to one who was unfit to practise it!’ Then he asked me whether I knew how it had all come about in the matter of Yūḥannā and his father. ‘No,’ I replied, ‘I am not familiar with the story.’ ‘Well,’ he said, ‘Hārūn al-Rashīd had assigned me responsibility for a hospital, and I decided to bring in Dahishtak, the superintendent of the Gondēshāpūr hospital, to take charge of my hospital. However, he demurred on the grounds that he would not be directly in the employ of the government and thus would not be assured of drawing a regular salary. Managing the Gondēshāpūr hospital, in collaboration with his brother’s son Mīkhāʾīl, was more satisfactory from that point of view. The Catholicos, Timothy,

It is a present of substantial value, and if you accept it, you will not regret having done so, for it will be very useful to you at your new hospital.” I asked him what his present was, and he explained that it was one of his own men. “He used to pound medical ingredients for us when he was young,” he said. “No one knows who his father was, and he seems to have no family. He has lived at the hospital for forty years; he must be fifty years old by this time, perhaps even older. He cannot read so much as a letter of any language, but he knows every ailment there is, and he also knows what medicines should be used to treat any given disorder. He is the most knowledgeable of God’s creation in assessing medicines, for he can infallibly select good ones and reject bad ones. I am making you a present of him. Assign him to whichever of your pupils you like, then make that pupil superintendent of your hospital; you will find that it will be better run than would be the case if you had appointed me superintendent.” I replied that I should be delighted to accept his present.’</p>

Upon examination, he appeared to be just as Dahishtak had described him. I asked him what his name was, and he replied that it was Māsawayh. At that time I was serving Hārūn al-Rashīd as his personal physician, while Dāwūd ibn Sarābīyūn was personal physician to Umm Jaʿfar.

                                    As it happened, the house where Māsawayh lived was a considerable distance from mine, but not far from Dāwūd’s. Dāwūd was a light-hearted, frivolous sort of fellow, and Māsawayh was subject to the weaknesses of the lower orders, so he revelled in the pleasures to which Dāwūd introduced him. It was not long before he came to me dressed quite differently, all in white. I asked him how he was doing, and he informed me that he was in love with a slave-girl who belonged to Dāwūd ibn Sarābīyūn, a Slav girl, he said, named Risālah. Would I buy her for him? I did buy the girl, for eight hundred dirhams, and gave her to Māsawayh, and she subsequently bore him two sons, Yūḥannā and his brother. Nor was that the end of the matter: having bought this Risālah for him, out of respect for his desire for offspring from her, I went on to treat his children as though they had been my own flesh and blood. I furthered their advancement and gave them precedence over the sons of noble practitioners and learned scholars of this profession. I saw to it that Yūḥannā was elevated to a position of responsibility, making him superintendent of the hospital and chief among my pupils. And now he repays me with this absurd allegation, which none can hear without cursing the one who uttered it, thereby giving vent to his own self-importance and talking arrant rubbish! It was precisely because of this sort of pernicious nonsense from jumped-up persons of the lower orders that the Persians strictly prohibited people from engaging in occupations other than those that had been practised by their fathers and grandfathers. To God we turn for help!’

One day Yūḥannā was drinking in his company when a cupbearer brought him a drink that was not pure and sweet, as was customary. This was a practice of cupbearers when they were insufficiently rewarded. When Yūḥannā drank the first cup he said: ‘O Commander of the Faithful, when it comes to tastes, I am very knowledgeable and expert, but the taste of this drink is unlike that of any others’.

In the afternoon, he asked Samānah if the money had been handed over. He replied ‘Not yet,’ and so the caliph doubled the sum. After the evening prayer he inquired about it again and was told that the money was not yet delivered. So he called Samānah and ordered him to send three hundred thousand dirhams. Samānah said to the treasurer: ‘Send out Yūḥannā’s money this minute or nothing will be left in the treasury.’ So the money was dispatched at once.</p>

                                <p>The teaching sessions of Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh attracted the largest audience of any I have seen in the city of Baghdad, whether conducted by a physician or theologian or philosopher, for every type of educated person assembled there. Yūḥannā was endowed with a great capacity for being funny, which was part of the reason for the large gatherings. His impatience and irascibility surpassed even those of Jabrāʾīl ibn Bukhtīshūʿ, his sharpness expressing itself in droll statements. His teaching was especially enjoyable in the sessions when he examined phials of urine.</p>

                                <p>Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh was afflicted by such a severe illness that his family despaired for him. Now the Christian custom when presented with someone for whom there is no hope is to have a group of monks, priests, and deacons read aloud around the bedside, and this was done for Yūḥannā. But Yūḥannā recovered while the monks were reciting, and so he said to them: ‘O offspring of wickedness, what are you doing in my house?’ They answered: ‘We were praying to our Lord to give you good health.’ But Yūḥannā replied to them: ‘One drop of rose-perfume is better that the prayers of all the people of Christendom from the beginning to the day of Resurrection. Get out of my house!’ And so they left.</p>

                                    ). Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh said: ‘This is not the right season for curing your illness. The treatment for this comes during the spring, when you must not eat anything spoilt, no fresh or salted fish, either small or large, and you must avoid all hot spices and herbs as well as dairy products.’ The man replied: ‘These are things that I simply cannot abstain from eating.’ Yūḥannā exclaimed: ‘If that is the case, then go on eating them and scratching your body, for if the Messiah came to you alone, you would not have benefited from his blessing, in view of your self-confessed greed!’

                                    The house of (his father-in-law) al-Ṭayfūrī was in the Christian Quarter in the eastern part of Baghdad, next to the house of Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh. Al-Ṭayfūrī had a son called Dāniyal who had been a good student of medicine, but then became a monk. The son came to Baghdād upon hearing of his father’s illness or something of the sort. Yūḥannā owned a peacock which used to perch on the wall between his house and al-Ṭayfūrī’s. Dāniyal arrived in Baghdād on a night during the month of August, a time of great heat and intense sultriness. Whenever the heat of the night oppressed the peacock, it screeched. The screeching woke Dāniyāl, who was clad in a monk’s woollen robe, and he tried several times to drive the peacock off, but it did no good. So Dāniyal raised his iron bar, hit the peacock on the head and killed it. Yūḥannā knew nothing of this until he went out riding and came back to happen by chance upon his peacock dead at the door of his house. He started swearing vengeance on its killer, when Dāniyal came out and said to him: ‘Do not vilify the killer, for I am the one who killed it, and I owe you several peacocks in its stead.’ Yūḥannā replied, in my presence: ‘I don’t like a monk with a huge cock and balls as big as a camel’s hump!’,

God gives the fisherman his living through catching fish, for this is the food for his family; the livelihood of the Commander of the Faithful, however, derives from the caliphate, and so he is not in need of any fish for a living. Were his living dependant on fishing, the fish would come to him the way they do to the fisherman.’</p>

Rather, I thought about dissecting her and composing a book in the style of Galen’s writing on anatomy, and dedicating it to the Commander of the Faithful. But in her body the arteries are small and the veins and nerves thin, and I had no hope that things would become as clear in her as they would be in a large body. So I left her alone so that she might grow large and her body thicken. However, since this male monkey has been provided, the Commander of the Faithful should be informed that I shall write for him a book the likes of which has never been written in Islam.</p>

Yūḥannā examined his urine and took his pulse, and then asked him about his condition – how he was in the evening, at night, and in the morning – until he got the whole story from him. Yūḥannā then said: ‘This fever of yours is one of the lightest forms of fevers as long as the patient does not eat noxious foods, for its most extreme form consists of seven bouts of fever but the most common form leaves after only four bouts. If however the patient eats noxious foods, the malady can change and sometimes be prolonged and on occasion even cause death.’

So Yūḥannā went to him one day, and I went with him.

However, since I am certain that you dislike good health and desire illness, I do not think it right to recommend anything.’ To which Ibn Mashghūf replied: ‘O fool!

Yūḥannā used to make a show of loving his son as a precaution against the tongues of al-Ṭayfūrī and his children. But in fact he hated him even more than he hated Sahl the Beardless, who had attacked his honour by claiming that he ‘had put it in his mother’s vagina’.

                                    came down with an illness that left him at the point of death. For that reason Yūḥannā went to visit him, but found him somewhat recovered. So there took place amongst us some story-telling, and one of the stories was the following:

                                        <p>ʿAmīrah, his grandfather, lost his full brother who did not leave any children, and the misfortune oppressed him greatly. After his brother’s death, a concubine of his showed signs of pregnancy and so some of his grief was lessened. He took her into his home and gave her precedence over his own wife. She gave birth to a daughter, and he fostered the girl and gave her precedence over both his male and female children. When she grew up, he wished to find a suitable husband for her, but no one could ask for her in marriage unless he would submit to scrutiny of his lineage and examination of his character.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            One of those wishing to ask for her in marriage was a cousin (
                                            <hi rend="italic">ibn ʿamm</hi>
                                            ) of Khālid ibn Ṣafwān ibn al-Ahtam al-Tamīmī. ʿAmīrah was well acquainted with the looks of the youth and his lineage, so he said to him: ‘My son, as to your lineage, there is no need to look into that, for you are a good match for my brother’s daughter in that respect. But there can be no agreement for a marriage contract with my daughter without my learning the character of the man to whom she would be bound. If it is convenient for you, stay with me in my house for a year, during which time I shall discover your character traits, just as I have disclosed the lineage and characters of others. You will be made welcome and comfortable. But if that is not convenient for you, then go back to your people. I have already given orders for your move to be arranged and to transport everything you might need until your arrival with your belongings.’

                                <p>I have heard from my father that my grandfather could not get through a single night with being tormented by conflicting views about the character of the man, one time concluding that the youth was the best possible, another time that he was the worst. The contradictions in his information compelled him to reject everything, and he abandoned the entire matter, on the basis that those who praised him were biased in his favour, while those who blamed him were biased against him. So, he wrote to Khālid as follows:</p>

A certain person proposed to us a marriage contract with your niece, named such and such, the daughter of such and such. If his character is as good as his lineage, then he is a desirable partner for his wife-to-be, and blessings on him who agrees to the marriage contract. But I shall decide on the basis of what you think should be done about your cousin and your niece, and I will act upon your trusted advice, God willing.</p>

                                <p>I have understood what you wrote. My cousin’s father was indeed both the best and the worst of my family – the best of them through his forgiveness of whoever wronged him and his generosity, but on the other hand he was debased through debauchery and contemptible morals. His mother was the loveliest of God’s creatures and the most virtuous, except that she had a bad temper, was stingy and as dull-witted as I have ever seen. This cousin of mine inherited the bad qualities of both his parents but none of their good qualities. If you still wish to pursue the marriage after what I have disclosed to you, then very well. But if you now find it disagreeable, I hope that God might choose someone for our niece.</p>

I entered with the usual greetings and encountered Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh there. Hārūn asked after my health and whom I had met recently, and so I told him of my visit to Ṣāliḥ ibn Shaykh. He said that I had been in a veritable goldmine of good, delightful stories and asked if I could remember one of them. So, I recounted this tale.</p>

I have been afflicted with a long face, a high cranium, a broad forehead, and blue eyes, but I have been blessed with intelligence and a memory for everything that takes place within my hearing. The daughter of al-Ṭayfūrī was the most beautiful woman I had seen or heard of, although she was stupid and simple-minded, not comprehending what she said and not understanding what was said to her. Our son received all of our bad qualities and was not endowed with any of her

[After seeing his son] Yūḥannā recommended blood-letting for him, while al-Ṭayfūrī and his sons Zakariyyā and Dāniyāl were of the opposite opinion. Yūḥannā performed the blood-letting on him and left for Syria on the following day. On the third day after his departure, Māsawayh died. At the funeral, al-Ṭayfūri and his sons swore that Yūḥannā had intended to kill him, and they offered as proof what had been said in the home of Hārūn ibn Sulaymān.</p>

                                    The caliph al-Mutawakkil said to him one day, ‘I sold my house for two castles,’ to which Yūḥannā replied, ‘Delay your breakfast, O Commander of the Faithful’. Al-Mutawakkil intended to say ‘I ate dinner and it disagreed with me,’ because this is its equivalent in [the kind of riddle] called
                                    <hi rend="italic">taṣḥīf</hi>
                                    . Ibn Māsawayh answered him with the treatment for what he had intended to say.

                                            This is a highly conscious and extremely artificial way of riddling, based on the written words without diacritical dots, whereby e.g.
                                            <hi rend="italic">bayt</hi>
                                            can stand for

                                            , etc.: if one writes the caliph’s utterance without dots or spaces:

But even if we allow that the two of them had the same nature, their mixture had a potency that was not to be found in one of them alone.’

                                    came to us (in Baghdad) in the year 221/837 and he was afflicted with a severe illness. No-one failed to go and see him, and the most important people sent their physicians to him, one of them being Ibn Masāwayh. When he had felt his pulse and examined him, he said ‘I do not detect as much illness as grief.’ The patient replied: ‘By God, it is not as if I have worldly desires, what with my eighty-two years! But humans are in a state of ignorance until they are made aware of this by illness. If I could stand for one time on Mount Arafat and visit the tomb of the Prophet, may peace be upon him, and perform some of things that are on my mind, then you would see that the severity of this would ease.’ Ibn Māsawayh replied to him: ‘Do not be grieved, for I detected in your arteries the innate heat and strength that, if God protects you in the present crisis, will give you ten more years to live.’

His brother, al-Muʿtaṣim accompanied him and they settled there and put their feet in it to cool them, for the water was very cold, pure, and pleasing. Al-Maʾmūn said to al-Muʿtaṣim: ‘Right now I would like to eat Azadh dates and drink this cold water with them.’ And immediately he heard the sound of the post-horses’ riggings and bells and someone calling ‘This is Yazīd ibn Muqbil of the Iraqi courier system.’ He produced a large silver tray with fresh dates on it, and al-Maʾmūn was astonished that his wish had been fulfilled. The two of them ate and drank water and then got up. Al-Maʾmūn took his leave and had a short rest, but then rose from that with a fever. Blood-letting was performed, but on his neck there appeared a swelling of a type he had had before, which the physician treated by letting it ‘ripen’, open up, and then heal. Al-Muʿtaṣim said to the physician, who was Ibn Māsawayh, ‘What a peculiar situation we find ourselves in! For you are a physician outstanding and unparalleled in his craft, and yet this swelling repeatedly returns to the caliph. Can you not destroy it and alleviate it by cutting it out so that it does not return? By God, if this affliction returns, then I will have you beheaded!’

                                    by this speech of al-Muʿtaṣim and he left. He later related the event to someone whom he trusted, and the man said: ‘Did you detect what al-Muʿtaṣim’s purpose was?’ ‘No’, was the reply. ‘He had directed you to kill him [al-Maʾmūn] so that the swelling would not return. It could be only that, for he knows that a physician cannot keep diseases from attacking people. Indeed, he told you not to let him live by saying that the disease should not return.’

                                    Then Ibn Māsawayh made his excuses and ordered a student of his to attend al-Maʾmūn in his place and examine the swelling. The student returned each day and informed him of al-Maʾmūn’s condition and new developments. Then he ordered the student to open the swelling, but the latter exclaimed ‘May God protect you! It has not reddened and has not reached the stage of suppuration.’ Ibn Māsawayh said to him: ‘Go on and open it, as I’ve told you to do, and do not consult again with me.’ And so the student did as directed and opened it, but al-Maʾmūn died, may God have mercy on him.

                                <p>I say that Ibn Māsawayh acted in that way because he was deficient in virtue, in religion, and fidelity. He was not a Muslim, but he did not even hold to his own religion, as is evident from the stories given above related by Yūsuf ibn Ibrāhīm. No sensible person should give credit to, nor a prudent person rely upon, someone who does not have a religion which he follows and to which he is bound.</p>

                                <p>Discussion with this physician was not a pleasant experience, for he never presented evidence in support of his allegations, and he distrusted any innovation that was of less than two hundred years’ standing, regardless of the views of other physicians. He would not use oxymel if the rose petals had been prepared with anything but honey, nor would he use rose water unless it had been made from rose petals steeped in hot water, with no sugar. Indeed, he would not use anything at all that had not been used by the great physicians of olden times. I asked him one day what he thought of bananas, ‘I have never found them referred to in the works of the great men of olden times,’ he replied, ‘and consequently I should not venture either to consume them myself or to advise other people to eat them.’ Al-Maʾmūn thought highly of him and gave him preference over Jibrīl ibn Bukhtīshūʿ, so much so that he would address him familiarly as ‘Abū so-and-so,’ rather than formally by his given name. The caliph would take no medicine that had not been compounded and finished by Mikhāʾīl. Every physician in Baghdad would treat him more respectfully than anyone else. I have observed this with my own eyes.</p>

They had all gone to examine her the previous day, scrutinizing her urine and taking her pulse; now, on this day, they examined her again, and they all said that she was on the mend, and that they had no doubt that she would recover. The thought crossed my mind that in thus pronouncing her in good health, they were seeking, or at any rate most of them were seeking, to please Abū Isḥāq.

                                    Accordingly, I followed them when they left and questioned each of them individually about what he really thought about Shiklah’s condition. They all told me what they had told the caliph, except Salmawayh ibn Bunān and Mīkhāʾīl. Salmawayh said she was worse than she had been the previous day, while Mīkhāʾīl said to me, ‘Yesterday, there was a swelling in the vicinity of her heart; today, we did not observe it. Has that swelling sunk into the ground, do you think, or flown off into the sky? You had better make the necessary preparations for this lady’s funeral; she will not last the night.’ In the event, she died at the time of the last evening prayer, about ten hours after Mīkhāʾīl had spoken those words to me.

                                    al-Maʾmūn said that he would like to have some of it.

                                    Accordingly, Ṭāhir wrote to his factor, instructing him to have some of the date-wine sent to him. In due course, a messenger arrived from al-Nahrawān,

                                    informing the caliph that some wine from Būshanj had been delivered to Ṭāhir. The caliph naturally expected the latter to bring him his date-wine, but day after day went by and it never appeared. Finally al-Maʾmūn asked him point-blank, ‘Have you by any chance received some date-wine in your postbag lately, Abū l-Ṭayyib?’ ‘I beseech you, O Commander of the Faithful,’ said Ṭāhir, ‘do not overwhelm me with disgrace and humiliation.’ ‘Whatever do you mean?’ asked the caliph. ‘The wine of which I told the Commander of the Faithful,’ answered Ṭāhir, ‘was some that I had drunk when I was poverty-stricken and living in a village that I hoped I might some day own; I had no higher aspiration. O Commander of the Faithful, God has now granted me more than I could ever have hoped for, and when I received that wine, I tasted it, and found that it was bad beyond words.’ ‘Bring me some of it none the less,’ said al-Maʾmūn, and when Ṭāhir brought him a flask of it, the caliph ordered the word ‘Ṭāhirī’ inscribed upon the flask, by way of poking fun at Ṭāhir, whose dreadful wine it was, and the flask stored in the cellars.

                                <p>There it remained for two years. One day, however, al-Maʾmūn’s doctors prescribed an emetic, and told him that there was no better emetic than bad date-wine. Someone remembered that that Ṭāhirī wine was reputed to be the worst in all Iraq, so the flask was brought up from storage. But when the caliph tasted it, he found it to be as good as Quṭrabbul date-wine, if not better. The air of Iraq had done wonders for it, as it does for all crops and the products that are pressed from them.</p>

                            Ḥunayn was a fluent, eloquent speaker and an accomplished poet. He lived for a time in Basra, where he studied Arabic grammar with al-Khalīl ibn Aḥmad.

                                    Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq was diligent and keenly interested in learning the art of medicine, but his initial experience in that connection was unfortunate. Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh gave courses in the subject which were attended by educated persons of every kind. I used to see Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq, the translator, reading, under Yūḥannā’s guidance,

                                    . At that time, Ḥunayn was constantly asking questions, much to Yūḥannā’s annoyance. Another factor that did not endear him to his teacher was the fact that Ḥunayn came of a family of money-changers in al-Ḥīrah, for the people of Gondēshāpūr, and in particular its physicians, looked down on the people of al-Ḥīrah and did not encourage tradesmen’s sons to enter their profession. It so happened one day that Ḥunayn asked Yūḥannā a question about a passage that he had read, which he was having some trouble understanding. Yūḥannā lost his temper. ‘The people of al-Ḥīrah are not fit to learn the art of medicine!’ he said. ‘You would do better to go to so-and-so, who is a relative of yours, and borrow fifty dirhams from him. For one dirham you can buy some little baskets; for three more, you can buy some orpiment.

Leave my house!’ So Ḥunayn departed for home in tears, humiliated and downcast.

                                    We saw no more of him for two years. It so happened, however, that the caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd had a Roman slave-girl named Kharshā whom he valued highly and had appointed to a post as storewoman. She had a sister (or it may have been a niece) who sometimes brought the caliph an item of clothing or something else that Kharshā kept in her wardrobes. Al-Rashīd noticed eventually that he had not seen her for some time, and asked Kharshā what had become of her, whereupon Kharshā informed him that she had given the girl in marriage to a kinsman. ‘What!’ said the caliph angrily, ‘without first obtaining my permission and purchasing her? for she is my property,’ and he ordered Sallām al-Abrash

Sallām soon ran him to earth, and, without so much as saying a word to him, had him seized, thrown down and castrated without further ado. However, the girl had already conceived by him, and in due course gave birth to a son, about the time of Hārūn al-Rashīd’s expedition to Tus,

                                    We would often meet at literary gatherings, and that, I felt, gave him a certain claim on me, so once when he fell ill, I went to visit him. There at his home, what should I see but a man with such a head of hair that it partially covered his face, so that I could not tell who he was. He was walking up and down, reciting some Greek poetry by Homer, the greatest of all the Greek poets, and the sound of his voice put me in mind of Ḥunayn, whom I had not seen for two years and more. ‘That’s Ḥunayn!’ I said to Isḥāq ibn al-Khaṣīy. He said no it wasn’t, but did not sound as though he meant it. I addressed the hirsute man tentatively: ‘Ḥunayn?’ and he acknowledged that it was indeed he. ‘The son of that whore Risālah,’

He had been translating parts of one of Galen’s works on anatomy: a Roman editor had taken the work in question and divided it up into sections, and Ḥunayn had translated a number of these sections for Jibrīl. Jibrīl was addressing him with the utmost respect as ‘Rabban (‘teacher’) Ḥunayn.’ Seeing my astonishment at this spectacle, Jibrīl said to me, ‘You need not consider that I am showing this young fellow undue respect. I tell you, if God preserves him, he will outshine not only Sergius but other translators as well.’ I should explain here that the Sergius to whom Jibrīl was alluding was Sergius of Resh ʿAynā,

I remained at Jibrīl’s house for quite a long time after Ḥunayn had left, but when I did leave, I found him outside the front door, where he had been waiting for me to appear. After greeting me, he said, ‘I once asked you not to divulge what I had been up to, but now I should like you to make the matter known, including what you have just heard Abū ʿĪsā say about me.’ ‘I shall be making Yūḥannā feel like a fool when I tell him how I heard Abū ʿĪsā praise you to the skies,’ I said. ‘To make him feel even more of a fool, show him this,’ said Ḥunayn, taking from his sleeve a copy of the translation he had done for Jibrīl, ‘without telling him that it was I who translated it, and then, once you see that he thinks it really excellent,

Christ has never inspired anyone; it is he himself who was inspired.’ ‘Spare me the sermon,’ said Yūḥannā, ‘I am sure this could have been produced only with the help of the Holy Ghost.’ ‘As a matter of fact,’ I said, ‘it is the work of Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq, whom you ordered out of your house and advised to sell doctored copper coins.’ ‘Impossible!’ he gasped. At length, however, he realized that I must be speaking the truth, and he begged me to use my good offices to effect a reconciliation between himself and Ḥunayn. I was able to bring this about, and from then on Yūḥannā treated Ḥunayn with the utmost respect and generosity, showering him with benefits. I observed this to be the case without interruption until I left Iraq in the year 225/840.

                            I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say that Ḥunayn and Yūḥannā ibn Māsawayh were closely associated from then on. Ḥunayn became Yūḥannā’s pupil and studied the art of medicine under his tutelage. At the same time, he translated numerous medical works for Yūḥannā, including works by Galen in particular, producing Syriac versions of some of them and Arabic versions of others.

                            The caliph al-Maʾmūn once reported that he had had a dream in which he seemed to see a distinguished-looking elderly gentleman sitting upon a pulpit, preaching; his name, he said, was Aristotle.

                            At that point, al-Maʾmūn awoke. Curious about his dream, he made enquiries as to who Aristotle was, and was informed that he had been a wise man of the Greeks. The caliph then had Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq summoned (for he knew of no other translator of comparable skill) and asked him to prepare Arabic translations of the works of the Greek philosophers. In return, he rewarded him lavishly with gold, silver and presents in abundance.

I shall ask him a question, I said to myself, and did so forthwith: “What is the good?” I asked. “That which reason tells us is good,” he replied. “Then what?” I asked. “What revealed law (Sharia) tells us is good,” he said. “Then what?” I asked. “What the mass of the people consider to be good,” he answered. “Then what?” he himself added. “Then there is no then,” he said.’ ”</p>

                                    This dream proved to be an important stimulus to the production of learned works. The caliph wrote to the Roman Emperor requesting his permission to select such scientific works of the ancients as were kept in the land of the Romans and have them brought to his capital. This was after al-Maʾmūn had defeated the Roman Emperor.

                                        <p>In the land of the Romans there is a temple of antique construction with a door more enormous than any ever seen, made of iron, and with two leaves. In ancient times, when the Greeks worshipped stars and idols, they venerated that temple and prayed there. I asked the Roman Emperor to have the door opened for me, but he refused, saying that it had been closed ever since the time when the Romans converted to the Christian religion. But I continued to press him on the matter, both verbally, when I was attending one of his receptions, and by letter, and finally he ordered it opened. It proved to be built of marble and huge blocks of stone in various colours, with great numbers of strikingly beautiful inscriptions and carvings upon them; I had never heard of or imagined anything like it. In that temple were such quantities of ancient books that a number of camels would have been required to carry them all (in subsequent retellings of this story, Isḥāq ibn Shahrām kept making the number larger, until finally he put it at a thousand camels). Some of these books were falling to pieces, others were in good condition, while still others had been devoured by worms.</p>

                                    In due course, Ḥunayn became an authority in his domain and his fame became widespread among the physicians of the day, so that the caliph

                                </p>
                                <p>Ḥunayn was accustomed to dress his hair in the Roman fashion, and while the caliph heard frequently of the physician’s learning, he would not take any medicine prescribed by him until he had consulted another physician, for he harboured a persistent suspicion that Ḥunayn might be acting as an agent for the Roman Emperor against himself. With a view to settling the matter once and for all, he determined to put him to the test. He had Ḥunayn summoned one day, ordered a robe of honour brought for him, and produced a deed granting him an estate in fee that brought in fifty thousand dirhams in revenue. Ḥunayn thanked the caliph for his generosity, and they spoke of other things. Finally the caliph said, ‘I want you to prescribe a potion for me that will kill an enemy whom I should be glad to have out of the way. This cannot be done openly, so I want to have it done discreetly.’ ‘O Commander of the Faithful,’ replied Ḥunayn, ‘I know only medicines that do my patients good; I should never have thought that the Commander of the Faithful would seek to obtain any other kind from me. But if you wish, I shall go and learn about harmful ones.’ ‘That would be a long business,’ objected the caliph, and he proceeded to ply Ḥunayn with blandishments and threats by turns, but to no avail: the physician merely repeated what he had originally said. Finally the caliph lost patience and ordered Ḥunayn confined in one of his fortresses, detailing a man to report on him at regular intervals, day in and day out.</p>
                                <p>Ḥunayn spent a full year in confinement. He showed no discomposure at his situation, but spent the entire time translating, commenting, and composing original works. At the end of the year, the caliph sent for him. When he arrived, he saw a well-filled purse laid out by way of enticement, along with a sword, a leathern mat, and other executioner’s instruments. ‘We meet again, Ḥunayn,’ said the caliph, ‘and the matter must be done as I described to you before. If you do as I asked, this purse is yours, and I have more in store for you. Refuse, and you must prepare to meet a dreadful fate.’ ‘As I have already told the Commander of the Faithful,’ replied Ḥunayn, ‘I am skilled only in respect of medicines that do good; I have no knowledge of other kinds.’ ‘Then I shall have you put to death!’ replied the caliph. ‘I rely on my Lord,’ said Ḥunayn calmly, ‘for He will justify me in the Great Place. If the Commander of the Faithful sees fit to wrong his own soul, he must do as he pleases.’ At this, the caliph smiled. ‘Be of good cheer, Ḥunayn,’ he said, ‘you may trust me: the purpose of all this charade was merely to put you to the test. I knew I was potentially vulnerable because of the wiles of kings and my own admiration for you, so I determined to put my mind at ease and make sure I could have confidence in you and benefit from your skill.’</p>
                                <p>At these words, Ḥunayn kissed the ground and thanked the caliph. ‘Tell me, Ḥunayn,’ the caliph continued, ‘what was it that prevented you from doing what I had asked you to do, even though it must have looked to you as though I meant what I said, both ways?’ ‘There were two things, Sire,’ Ḥunayn replied, ‘my religion and my profession.’ ‘Pray explain,’ said the caliph, and Ḥunayn went on, ‘Our religion commands us to do good and to show kindness even to our enemies; how much more, then should we behave in that way toward our friends and associates? And whoever fails to observe this commandment is excluded and banned from the community. My profession, for its part, prohibits me from doing harm to my fellow creatures, because it was instituted for their benefit and is intended only to do them good. Furthermore, God has made us physicians subject to an obligation, to which we must subscribe by solemn oaths, not to administer any lethal potion, nor anything harmful to our patients. I did not consider that I could contravene this twofold prohibition, and therefore I prepared myself to face execution. I was confident, you see, that God would not abandon one who had given up his life for the sake of His commandments, but would reward me.’ ‘Admirable laws, both of them,’ said the caliph approvingly, and he ordered a robe of honour to be brought for Ḥunayn and placed the purse in his hands, so that Ḥunayn left his presence wealthy and highly respected.</p>

                            Both of them studied the art of medicine, and their father composed manuals of instructions for them, designed to teach them its basic principles. He also translated many of the works of Galen for their benefit. I have not found any evidence that Dāwūd was noteworthy as a physician, nor does he seem to have left any written works as monuments to his skill and proficiency, apart from a single

He also translated many Greek works into Arabic, but as a translator he dedicated himself primarily to the works of the philosophers, such as Aristotle and others.

We may say that, in general, all Galen’s works that we have at our disposal are translated versions by Ḥunayn, or else corrected by him in cases where the Arabic version is the work of another translator.

He was provided with a staff of experienced translators, who produced the draft versions; they were then revised by Ḥunayn. The translators who worked under him included Iṣṭifan ibn Basīl

                                <p>Ḥunayn served al-Mutawakkil ʿalā llāh as his personal physician, and during that time his career flourished. He always wore the girdle that marked him as a Christian. Alexandria was where he had learned his Greek. He was a master translator: it was he who explained terms used in the works of Hippocrates and Galen, prepared admirable summaries of those works, shed light on difficult passages in them, and resolved their problematic aspects. He also composed a number of elegant original works which are useful and instructive. His approach to the works of Galen was that of the Alexandrians: he recast them very skilfully into question-and-answer form.</p>

He would then get up and perfume himself with incense, and then his meal would be served. This consisted of a large, well-fattened capon prepared with sugar, almonds and vinegar, and a loaf of bread weighing two hundred dirhams. He would sip the broth, then eat the capon and the bread, and then sleep. When he awoke, he would drink four

                                    During the reign of al-Mutawakkil, messengers from the caliph’s palace came to my house one night looking for me and saying that the caliph wanted me. They were followed by a whole group of others, then a second group, and finally Zarāfah himself;

                                    he dragged me out of bed and set off with me at a run, finally showing me into the caliph’s presence with the words, ‘This is Ḥunayn, Sire.’ ‘Pay Zarāfah what I said I would give him,’ said al-Mutawakkil to his attendants, whereupon the servant was given a purse of thirty thousand dirhams. The caliph then turned to me and said, ‘I am hungry. What do you advise me to have for supper?’ so I suggested a menu. After he had finished his meal, I asked them why I had been summoned as I had been, and was informed that a singer had performed before the caliph, and that the caliph had asked who the composer of the song was and had been told that it was Ḥunayn ibn Balūʿ al-ʿIbādī. Al-Mutawakkil had then ordered Zarāfah to have him brought to the palace. ‘Unfortunately, I do not know him, O Commander of the Faithful,’ said Zarāfah. ‘I must have him,’ cried the caliph. ‘Bring him here, and you shall have thirty thousand dirhams.’ So he brought me instead, but by the time I got there, al-Mutawakkil had forgotten about the matter, owing to the date-wine that he had imbibed; he knew only that he felt hungry. So I advised him to drink no more date-wine, to have his supper and to retire to bed, and that is what he did.

                                    Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq, died of grief one night during the reign of al-Mutawakkil. I was informed of this by the vizier of the Commander of the Faithful, al-Ḥakam bi-Allāh.

                                            harmful for a hangover.” After listening to the two physicians dispute the matter for a few minutes, the caliph ordered each of them to demonstrate the soundness of his position. “Sire,” said Ḥunayn, “a hangover is the state of the person suffering from that condition. The sun is harmful, not to the hangover, but to the person who has it.” Al-Ṭayfūrī could think of absolutely nothing to say to this, while al-Mutawakkil remarked approvingly that Ḥunayn undoubtedly had a better grasp of the nature and definitions of words than his colleagues.’

                                        <p>‘The very same day al-Ṭayfūrī drew from his sleeve a book in which there was an illustration of Christ on the cross, with a number of people about him, and showed it to Ḥunayn. “Are those the men who crucified Christ, Ḥunayn?” he asked. “Yes,” replied Ḥunayn. “Spit on them, then,” said al-Ṭayfūrī. “No, I will not,” said Ḥunayn. “And why not?” al-Ṭayfūrī demanded. “Because,” Ḥunayn explained, “they are not really the men who crucified Christ, but only a picture of them.” This reply enraged al-Ṭayfūrī, and he went to the caliph and asked him to allow a Christian religious tribunal to pass judgement on Ḥunayn. Al-Mutawakkil consulted the Catholicos and his bishops, and they all concluded that Ḥunayn had merited anathema. Accordingly, he was ceremoniously cursed seventy-fold in the presence of the whole Christian community, and his girdle was cut off. The caliph, for his part, announced that henceforth he would take no medicine prescribed by Ḥunayn unless al-Ṭayfūrī had overseen its preparation. Ḥunayn departed to his home home and died that very night, it is said of grief and chagrin.’</p>

                            who was consumed with hatred and envy toward Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq because of his learning, his skill, his excellence as a translator and his worldly success, sought to turn al-Mutawakkil against him by means of slander and innuendo. He managed to make the caliph so suspicious that Ḥunayn fell out of favour and ultimately was imprisoned. But then God, exalted is He, came to his aid: Bukhtīshūʿ ibn Jibrīl’s machinations became known, and Ḥunayn was released and restored to favour in the eyes of al-Mutawakkil, who gave him preference over Bukhtīshūʿ and all the other physicians, and he retained that status for the rest of his life. Ḥunayn finally fell ill and died in the year 264/877.

                            I have been able to ascertain the truth of all this from none other than Ḥunayn himself, for I have come upon an epistle written by him in which he describes the trials and tribulations that befell him at the hands of the celebrated physicians of his time who were hostile to him. The following, then, is his own account, in his own handwriting:

                                <p>I had to endure much from my enemies and those who persecuted me, displaying rank ingratitude for the benefits they had enjoyed at my hands, refusing to acknowledge my rights, oppressing me and harbouring hostility toward me. They subjected me to such a series of trials, misfortunes and calamities that I was unable to sleep; I lay miserably with my eyes wide open, and I was unfit to perform my duties. The reason was their envy of me for my learning and for the advantages that God, mighty and glorious is He, had granted me over my contemporaries. Most of them were my own kindred and family members! It was they who were the main source of my hardships and the root of my trials. After them came those whom I had taught, who had studied under me, whom I had treated generously, supported, and favoured over all the other practitioners of the art of medicine in the land. I had introduced them to the science of the great Galen, and in return for the good I had done them they repaid me with evil, in accordance with their natures. They spread the vilest calumnies about me while concealing whatever good qualities I had, with the result that my reputation was tainted; people looked at me askance. I was constantly watched; my words were scrutinized with intense suspicion, so that my slightest utterance, albeit quite innocent in intention, was taken to be full of significance. By these means, my enemies roused hatred against me, not only among adherents of my own religion, but among those of other religions as well; congregations were assembled expressly for the purpose of publicizing malicious interpretations of statements I had made.</p>

                                    I unfailingly praised God and resolved to endure the tribulation, putting my trust in Him. My life became extremely difficult: I was imprisoned, and for a time my hand touched never a dinar, nor a dirham,

                                    nor a book; I had not so much as a single page to read. And then God, mighty and glorious is He, looked upon me with a compassionate eye: He restored the blessings He had previously vouchsafed me and renewed His favour as I had known it before. My reversion to prosperity was attributable to a person who had been particularly and persistently hostile to me, and herein we may see that Galen was right in saying that the best men may reap advantage from their worst enemies.

                                <p>At this point, I propose to relate an account of how all the above came about. How should I not be hated, with the numbers of those who envy me so great and slanderous remarks about me at gatherings of important persons so prevalent? Large sums of money were expended on attempts on my life; those who reviled me grew strong, and those who honoured me were despised. I, for my part, was guilty of no offence; I had not wronged any of them in any way. But they saw that I had outdone them, that I knew more than they did and had achieved greater things than they, that I had translated great scientific works for them from languages that they were far from mastering, or of which they knew nothing at all. They perceived that my translations were admirable models of elegance and clarity, free of errors or defects, containing no bias in favour of any religion, and nothing ambiguous or ungrammatical. In saying this, I rely on the authority of acknowledged Arab experts on eloquence, scholars who are learned in all aspects of grammar and are familiar with uncommon expressions. None of them has ever detected an error of usage, an incorrect vowelling, or an injudicious shade of meaning, but only the most mellifluous and readily intelligible style. My works can be understood, admired and appreciated even by someone who is not himself a physician, knows nothing of philosophical method, and does not profess the Christian religion or any other religion; indeed, just such lay individuals regularly pay me substantial sums for works that I have translated, preferring them to the versions produced by others. I may also say unhesitatingly that other educated men of various religious persuasions have appreciated me, have shown me respect, have gratefully accepted what I gave them, and have repaid me handsomely.</p>
                                <p>But these Christian physicians, whom I have known all their lives and who learned their art under my tutelage, most of them, are the very ones who want to see my blood shed, even though I am indispensable to them. ‘Who is Ḥunayn?’ they have been known to say. ‘He only translates these works because he is paid to translate them, after the fashion of any artisan; we fail to see any difference. A blacksmith may make a sword for a mounted warrior for a dinar or so, earning perhaps a hundred dinars a month by his trade. Now, Ḥunayn is a servant who makes the instrument that we use, but he does not use it himself, just as the blacksmith may be skilful at the craft of making a sword, but not at using one. A blacksmith will never be a mounted warrior. Similarly, a translator has nothing to say about the art of medicine. Ḥunayn has no skill in matters of illness and has never diagnosed a disease. He wants to be like us, that’s all, and to be known as Ḥunayn the Physician rather than Ḥunayn the Translator. He would do better to stick to his craft and desist from talking about our art; that would be advantageous for him, as he would get his hands on more of our money and we should show him more respect if he would stop taking pulses, examining phials of urine and prescribing medicines.’ They say, ‘Whenever Ḥunayn calls on a patient, regardless of whether the people of the house belong to the cream of society or the common folk, they snigger when he comes in, and they laugh behind his back when he leaves.’</p>
                                <p>
                                    Whenever I heard this kind of thing said, I was distressed to such an extent that I thought of killing myself from sheer exasperation and indignation. I had no way of striking back, for one man alone cannot resist a large number of enemies who are in league against him. All the while, however, I realized that they were doing what they did out of nothing but envy. They were well aware of the vicious nature of their behaviour, but envy has always motivated human actions. Anyone with some knowledge of religion will recall that the first envious person on earth was Cain, who killed his brother Abel because God had not accepted his offering, whereas He had accepted Abel’s. Envy thus being a phenomenon of such antiquity, it is not surprising that I, too, should be among those injured by it. But, as the saying goes, ‘Envy is its own punishment.’ Another saying runs, ‘The envious man will kill himself before he will ever kill his enemy.’ The ancient Arabs have coined many sayings about envy, and there are numerous passages of poetry dealing with the subject. Here is one example:

                                <p>This poet and others have composed much more in a similar vein; it would be wearisome and unprofitable to quote them all.</p>
                                <p>And yet, most of them, when confronted with a case of serious illness, would come to me to ask me to confirm the nature of the condition, prescribe the appropriate medicine and lay out a course of treatment. This happened so frequently that there can be no doubt that my advice was sound. Yet the physicians who came to consult me and accepted my recommendations were the very ones who denounced me most virulently and subjected me most frequently to vile slander. I, for my part, did not seek to defend myself, relying on the Lord of All to judge between me and my detractors. Why? Simply because there were not merely one, two or three of them, but fifty-six, all members of my own Christian faith. I did not need them, but they needed me; moreover, many of them served caliphs, the lords of the realm, and thus wielded considerably influence. I was weaker than they were in two respects: in the first place, I was alone against them, and in the second place, any people who were well-disposed toward me could not do without the main source of my enemies’ power, namely, the Commander of the Faithful.</p>
                                <p>Despite all this, I did not complain to anyone about my situation, bad though it was. On the contrary, I would praise my detractors on official occasions, in the presence of eminent persons. Sometimes I would be told, ‘They openly disparage you and speak ill of you,’ but I would pretend that I did not believe such tales and refused to take the allegations seriously. ‘I am one of them,’ I would say, ‘we share the same religion, we are fellow-townsmen, and we practise the same profession; I do not believe that such men would slander anyone, least of all me.’ When my adversaries heard of this, they would say to one another, ‘He is alarmed, that’s why he holds his tongue.’ But the more they slandered me, the more I would praise them.</p>

                                    had concocted a scheme against me which he brought off successfully and thus did me harm, as he had sought to do. He began by obtaining an icon bearing an image of Our Lady Mary holding Our Lord Jesus Christ in her lap, with angels all about them. It was very beautifully painted and most lifelike, and Bukhtīshūʿ had paid a high price for it. He had it sent to al-Mutawakkil, the Commander of the Faithful, taking care to ensure that he was there in person to take it from the hands of the servant who brought it in; he presented it to the caliph himself, and al-Mutawakkil said admiringly that it was very fine. Bukhtīshūʿ then proceeded to kiss the image repeatedly. ‘Why are you doing that?’ asked the caliph. ‘Whose image then should I kiss, Sire,’ answered Bukhtīshūʿ ‘if not that of Our Lady, the lord of all beings?’ ‘Do all you Christians do that?’ al-Mutawakkil asked. ‘Yes, we do, O Commander of the Faithful,’ said Bukhtīshūʿ, ‘and with greater fervour than this, for I am acting with exceptional restraint, being in your presence. But despite the preference of our Christian community, I know of one man who is in your service, enjoying the benefits and drawing a salary. Although a Christian, yet he despises her and spits on her. He is a miscreant and a heretic, who does not affirm the unity of God and knows nothing of the life to come. His Christianity is merely a cloak; in reality, he denies the existence of God and does not believe in the message of the prophets.’ ‘Who is the person you have been describing?’ asked al-Mutawakkil. ‘Ḥunayn, the translator,’ replied Bukhtīshūʿ. ‘I shall have him sent for,’ said the caliph, ‘and if the matter proves to be as you have stated, I shall make an example of him: I shall have him tortured repeatedly and made to suffer severely, and then I shall have him thrown into the Muṭbaq prison

                                    and left there.’ ‘I should be greatly obliged if the Commander of the Faithful would wait an hour or so before having him brought in,’ said Bukhtīshūʿ. ‘Very well,’ said the caliph, and Bukhtīshūʿ took his leave.

                                <p>Immediately upon leaving the palace, he came straight to my house. ‘Abū Zayd,’ he said, ‘may God honour you, I must tell you that the Commander of the Faithful has been given an icon that he finds most impressive. It is a Syriac piece, I think. But the caliph has been saying how fine it is, and if we leave it in his possession and praise it in his hearing, he will urge us to share his enthusiasm for it on every possible occasion and say, “Look at this painting, it is your Lord and His mother.” He has already been at me about it. “Look at this painting,” he said, “isn’t it exquisite? Don’t you agree?” “Well, Sire,” I said to him, “it is a painting such as may be seen in baths and churches and other places that are decorated. It is of no interest and no importance to us.” “It means nothing to you, then?” he said. “Nothing,” I said. “If you are telling the truth,” he said, “let me see you spit on it.” So I spat on it, and then took my leave, while he roared with laughter. As you can imagine, I did that only to encourage him to throw the icon away and not keep badgering us about it and constantly throwing us into prominence. Someone might become resentful, and that would make matters worse. So if by any chance he sends for you and asks you the same sorts of questions that he put to me, it would be best for you to do what I did. I have already been to see those of our colleagues who attend his receptions and urged them to do the same.’ I swallowed his instructions and he was successful in making a complete fool of me.</p>

                                <p>Not more than an hour after he had left, a runner from the caliph arrived and escorted me to the palace. I saw the icon as soon as I entered; it was set before al-Mutawakkil. ‘Ḥunayn,’ he said, ‘would you not say that this picture is beautiful and impressive?’ ‘Oh, yes, indeed it is, O Commander of the Faithful,’ I agreed politely. ‘What do you think of it?’ he persisted. ‘Why, Sire,’ I said, ‘it is a painting, such as may commonly be seen in baths or churches or other places that are decorated with paintings.’ ‘But,’ he said, ‘is it not a picture of your Lord and His mother?’ ‘God forbid, O Commander of the Faithful,’ I said, ‘that God should be portrayed or that there should be a likeness of Him. This is a painting much like those seen in places in which paintings are used for embellishment.’ ‘In a word, then, it has no power, either for good or for ill?’ asked the caliph. ‘Exactly, O Commander of the Faithful,’ I said. ‘If that really is the case,’ he said, ‘spit on it.’ So I did spit on it, and no sooner had I done so than he had me arrested.</p>

As soon as he entered and saw the icon that was set before the caliph, even before having formally greeted al-Mutawakkil, he fell upon it, embraced it, and kissed it repeatedly, his eyes brimming with tears. Some of the servants went to restrain him, but the caliph motioned them back. After having kissed the icon at length in this manner, he took it, got to his feet, and treated al-Mutawakkil to an elaborate formal salutation. The caliph returned his greeting and bade the Catholicos be seated, whereupon he took a seat, cradling the icon on his knees. ‘What is this?’ said the caliph, ‘who are you to take something that was set before me and hold it on your knees without my permission?’ ‘O Commander of the Faithful,’ replied the Catholicos, ‘I have a better claim to this object that was set before you, even though the rights of the Commander of the Faithful, may God prolong his life, are paramount. My religion does not allow me to leave an image of Christ and Our Lady on the floor in a place where its significance is not understood, or where perhaps there is no awareness that is has any significance. An image like this should be hung in a place where due honour is shown it, where lamps with the finest oils are kept burning before it, along with candles that are never snuffed, a place often fragrant with the most precious incense.’
                                </p>
                                <p>‘You may go on holding it for the time being,’ said al-Mutawakkil. ‘A boon, Sire,’ said the Catholicos. ‘Would the Commander of the Faithful give me this icon and grant me an estate in fee that will bring me one hundred thousand dinars in revenue yearly, so that I may ensure that the icon is shown the reverence that is its due? Then the Commander of the Faithful may ask of me what he will concerning the matter for which he had me sent for.’ ‘The image is yours,’ said the caliph, ‘but what I want you to tell me is, what should be done with a man who spat upon it, in your view?’ ‘If the man was a Muslim,’ replied the Catholicos, ‘no blame could be attached to him, for he would not be aware of the significance of this icon. In view of the gravity of his act, however, he should be informed about the matter and sternly rebuked, to ensure that he would not do such a thing again. If the offender was a Christian, but ignorant, so that he did not realize what he had done, he should be publicly rebuked, denounced, threatened with excommunication and anathema, and upbraided until he repented. I should say that, in general, such an act could be committed only by an ignorant person who had no understanding or religion. But if the offender was acting in full awareness of what he was doing, he would in effect have spat on Mary, the mother of Our Lord, and upon Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself.’ ‘What punishment would you consider appropriate for a person who had done such a thing?’ asked al-Mutawakkil. ‘O Commander of the Faithful,’ replied the Catholicos, ‘I have no authority to apply lash or rod, nor do I have a narrow cell in which to confine an offender, but I should declare him anathema, forbid him to enter a church or to receive the Eucharist, and forbid all Christians to associate with him or speak to him, thereby condemning him to isolation. He would remain an object of abhorrence to us all until such time as he repented and mended his ways. Once he had changed for the better, given some of his fortune as alms to the poor and needy, and purified himself with protracted fasting and prayer, we should apply the words of our Scripture: “Except ye forgive sinners, your sins shall not be forgiven you.” The anathema would be withdrawn, and we and he should be once again as we had originally been.’ At these words, the caliph told the Catholicos to take the icon and do with it as he would, and ordered that he should be given a bag of dirhams to spend on it. The Catholicos then left, while al-Mutawakkil remained lost in thought for a time, wondering at the prelate’s behaviour and his love and veneration for such an object of adoration. ‘A strange matter altogether,’ he remarked at length.</p>

                                <p>Then the caliph ordered me to be brought in. Calling for a whip and ropes, he ordered his men to strip me and tie me up, and I was given a hundred lashes then and there. He then ordered me held in close confinement and subjected to torture, while a gang of ruffians was sent to confiscate all my goods and chattels, furniture, books and such things. In addition, al-Mutawakkil ordered my houses demolished down to groundwater level. Meanwhile, I remained imprisoned in the palace for six months under dreadful conditions, so that any who caught sight of me could not but pity me. Furthermore, every few days he would send a number of toughs to beat me and torture me anew.</p>
                                <p>I was subjected to this treatment until, after I had been in detention for three months and five days, the caliph was laid low by a grave illness. He was so severely stricken that he was unable even to move, and was given up for lost. He himself despaired of his life. However, the physicians who were my enemies never left his side for a moment, day or night, incessantly treating him, plying him with remedies, and all the while urging him to do something about me. ‘Our master the Commander of the Faithful would do well to dispose of that heretic and miscreant,’ they would say, ‘for ridding the world of him would relieve religion of a heavy burden.’ At length, after having endured some days of this sort of thing, al-Mutawakkil finally asked them, ‘What would you have me do with him?’ ‘Best to relieve the world of him altogether,’ they said. To make matters worse, whenever someone sympathetic to me would enquire about me or speak favourably about me to the caliph, Bukhtīshūʿ would say, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, this is one of his pupils and shares his opinions.’ There were few who were supporting me and many who were working against me, and I despaired of my life.</p>
                                <p>After all this incessant badgering and insistence, the caliph finally agreed to have me put to death. ‘I shall have him executed tomorrow morning and thus relieve you of him,’ he told his physicians. They were delighted, and went home well pleased with themselves, while a flunky from the palace came to inform me of al-Mutawakkil’s decision. Forthwith I prayed to God mighty and glorious, asking Him to favour me once more with the grace that I had previously known at His hands, for I was sorely distressed and heavy of heart at what was to befall me on the morrow. I had done nothing to deserve such a fate; I was guilty of no crime, but rather was a victim of those who had conspired against me and were determined to have me murdered. ‘O God,’ I prayed, ‘You know that I am innocent, and it is fitting that You should come to my aid.’ Having done this, I lay brooding until finally I fell asleep.</p>

                                    In due course the keeper appeared and opened the door of my cell. It was not his usual time, and I thought, ‘This is a bad sign. It is going to happen after all, just as I was told yesterday. My enemies are about to have the satisfaction of witnessing my downfall,’ and I prayed to God for help. But hardly had the keeper taken his seat when a slave-boy entered with a barber in tow. ‘Up you get, you lucky fellow,’ said the keeper, ‘you are about to have your hair cut.’ My hair was trimmed, and then I was taken to the bath, where I was washed clean and anointed with perfume, for so our master, the Commander of the Faithful, had ordered. When I emerged from the bath, I was arrayed in fine clothes and then taken to the keeper’s lodge, where I waited until all the physicians had assembled before the caliph, each in his assigned place. Finally the caliph called out, ‘Bring Ḥunayn in!’ The physicians were quite sure that they were about to see me executed. I was ushered into the salon. Al-Mutawakkil looked at me and motioned for me to come closer, finally bidding me be seated immediately in front of him. Then he spoke: ‘I have forgiven you for the sin you committed, acceding to the request of one who has spoken for you. Praise God, then, for your life. Now take my pulse and prescribe whatever treatment you think fit, for I have been ill for a long time.’ I took his pulse and advised him to take purging cassia

My enemies, the other physicians, urged him not to touch it. ‘God forbid, Sire,’ they chorused, ‘some dreadful mischief is certain to befall you if you take that medicine.’ ‘Silence, the lot of you!’ roared the caliph. ‘I have been told to take whatever he prescribes for me,’ and he ordered the medicine prepared immediately. It was brought in, and he swallowed it then and there.

                                    Then al-Mutawakkil spoke to me. ‘Ḥunayn,’ he said, ‘I must beg your pardon for what I did to you. A very powerful person has interceded with me on your behalf.’ ‘I pardon you willingly, Sire,’ I replied, ‘and how could I do otherwise, since you have spared my life?’ The caliph then turned to the assembled physicians. ‘I want you all to listen carefully to what I am about to say,’ he said to them, and they all hearkened attentively. ‘When you all left yesterday evening,’ he went on, ‘you were aware that I intended to have Ḥunayn put to death this morning, as I had told you I would do. Afterward, I lay awake in severe pain for half the night, but finally fell asleep and had a dream. In my dream, I was sitting in a narrow place. You physicians were there, but you were a long way off, with my household staff and retinue. I was saying to you, “You wretched crew, why are you looking at me like that? What are we doing here? Is this a fitting place for such a person as myself?” but you answered not a word. In the midst of all this, a great, terrifying light suddenly shone upon me in that place. As I sat there petrified with fear, I became aware that somehow there was a man standing beside me, a man with a face glorious in its beauty, and with another man, dressed in fine clothing, standing behind him. He greeted me, and I returned his greeting. Then he asked, “Do you know who I am?” “No,” I answered, whereupon he said, “I am Jesus Christ.” This caused me to quake with alarm. “Who is that person with you?” I asked. “Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq,” Christ replied. “Please excuse me,” I said, “but I am unable to stand to shake hands with you.”

                                <p>‘I then awoke,’ the caliph went on, ‘overcome with distress at the suffering I had caused to be inflicted upon Ḥunayn and reflecting on the powerful intercessor who had approached me on his behalf. It is now incumbent upon me to ensure that justice is done. I am dismissing the lot of you: Ḥunayn shall henceforth be my attending physician, in accordance with Christ’s bidding. Furthermore, those of you who demanded that I have him put to death shall be liable for the blood-price. Every one of you who was here last night is to bring me ten thousand dirhams, and any of you who fails to pay that amount will be beheaded. Those who were not present are not liable and are not required to pay.’ Turning to me, he then said, ‘You may take your seat and assume the duties of your office.’ All the assembled physicians hurriedly took their leave, and every one of them returned shortly with ten thousand dirhams. Once all that coin had been gathered together, the caliph ordered an equal amount to be added from his own treasury and the total given to me; it came to more than two hundred thousand dirhams.</p>
                                <p>By the time the day was drawing to a close, the medicine I had administered had sent al-Mutawakkil to the lavatory three times, with the result that he was greatly relieved and feeling better. ‘Ḥunayn,’ he said, ‘you shall have whatever you wish, for I have the utmost regard for you, and you shall enjoy much greater prestige than you formerly did. I shall compensate you many times over for what you have lost, make your enemies subject to your authority, and raise you in rank above all other practitioners of your art.’ He then ordered that three houses belonging to him should be fitted up for me, such houses as I had never lived in, nor ever known any other physician to live in, in all my life. They were valuable houses, worth thousands of dinars. The caliph had them formally conveyed into my possession, with documents signed in the presence of witnesses, for he wished to ensure that they should be my property and the property of my descendants, and that no one should have any grounds for challenging my ownership of them. Once this was done, he had the houses fitted out with everything I might need in the way of vessels, carpets, utensils, books and the like. All this he did out of affection and regard for me.</p>
                                <p>Once the houses had been fully furnished and fitted and hung with curtains of various kinds in accordance with al-Mutawakkil’s instructions, nothing remained but for me to move in. The caliph had the money, by now swollen to a great total, placed in my hands. He then arranged for me to be carried thither with five of his own finest mules, splendidly equipped, and he also gave me three Roman servants. Furthermore, he ordered that I was to be paid fifteen thousand dirhams a month, besides a lump-sum payment covering all the time I had been in prison, which made a very handsome total indeed. In addition to all this, the caliph’s household staff, the ladies of the harem, the remainder of his retinue and his family all contributed incalculable quantities of coin, robes of honour and estates in fee. The functions I had formerly performed amid the general populace, outside the caliph’s palace, I performed henceforth inside it. I became al-Mutawakkil’s chief physician, with all the others, friends and enemies both, subject to my authority. Thanks to the hostility of malevolent individuals, then, I attained complete felicity; as Galen says, good men may benefit from the actions of their wicked adversaries. Galen certainly had to endure severe trials, but, by my life, they were trifling compared to mine!</p>
                                <p>I found that as often as not, the first person to come to my door in the morning to seek my influence in obtaining a favour from the Commander of the Faithful, or to consult me about some illness that had baffled him, would be one of those enemies at whose hands I had known the hardships that I have described. And, by the truth of my Lord, who is the First Cause, I would promptly do favours for them and act toward them with sincerity. Never did I seek to avenge myself upon a single one of them for what he had done to me. I became an object of wonder for my willingness to oblige these physicians, once it became known what they had said about me, quite openly, and even in the presence of the Commander of the Faithful. Moreover, I would translate books for them, as meticulously as always, without charging them anything, so anxious was I to show my good will toward them, whereas formerly it had been usual, whenever I translated a work for one of them, for me to be paid a purse of silver dirhams equal in weight to the translated work.</p>

                            I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – here insert the following comment. I have found large numbers of these works, and have purchased a good many of them. They are written in
                            <hi rend="italic">muwallad</hi>
                            Kūfic script in the handwriting of al-Azraq, Ḥunayn’s secretary. The letters are written very large, with broad strokes, and the lines are widely spaced. The paper is very heavy, being three or four times as thick as the paper manufactured nowadays, while the sheets are trimmed to about one third the size of a sheet of Baghdādī paper. Ḥunayn had his works published in that fashion to make them bulkier and increase their weight, inasmuch as he was paid weight for weight in silver dirhams. It is thus clear that he used that particular type of paper deliberately. Small wonder, then, that the manuscripts have lasted so well for so long.
                        </p>
                        <p>Resuming Ḥunayn’s narrative:</p>

This being the case, as it undoubtedly is – misfortune may strike anyone – a reasonable man should never despair of God’s providence or the prospect of deliverance from his predicament. Rather, he should cling fast to his trust in his Creator, lauding and glorifying Him. Praised be God, who granted me a second life and enabled me to overcome the wicked machinations of my enemies, raising me above them in rank and position. Praised be He now and forevermore!</p>

                                    There is a good deal of variation among manuscripts of this work. Moreover, the several treatises are not organized on the same plan, some of them being brief, covering their subject in a small compass, while others are needlessly discursive and drawn out to an excessive length. That is because each of the treatises was composed as a discrete entity, no consideration having been given to its integration with the others as components of the work as a whole, and the reason why that is the case is to be found in the final treatise, where the author tells us, ‘In response to requests from various individuals over a period of thirty-odd years, I composed a number of treatises on the eye, dealing with different aspects of the subject.’ He goes on to say, ‘Ḥubaysh then suggested to me that I should collect them and make a single book out of them, and that to the nine treatises that were already written I should add a tenth consisting of a summary presentation of the compound medicines used by the physicians of antiquity as expounded in their works on disorders of the eye.’

                        <p>Ḥubaysh ibn al-Ḥasan al-Dimashqī was the son of Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq’s sister, and studied the art of medicine under his uncle’s tutelage. He followed Ḥunayn’s example in his work as a translator and also in his speech and conduct, but was by no means the equal of his mentor.</p>

                            Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq mentions his nephew in various passages in his works.

                            According to him, the younger man was intelligent and perceptive, but did not fully live up to his potential because he did not make the necessary effort. ‘Keen intelligence or no keen intelligence,’ says Ḥunayn, ‘the fact is, he is rather slack.’

On that occasion, he recalled the great man’s kindness and generosity toward him, and then said that Ṣāʿid had been working to nullify his master’s favourable treatment by sending letters to governors and prefects implying that Yūḥannā’s estates and other properties did not really belong to him. Al-Muwaffaq told him to return to his encampment, saying reassuringly that his own view of the matter had not changed. He then sent for Ṣāʿid. ‘You know perfectly well,’ he said to the vizier, ‘that there is no one in this world whose company I find more congenial, who sees more deeply into my heart, and who relieves my anxiety more reliably, than Yūḥannā. Yet here you are, persistently scheming to make my life miserable by distracting him from his duty to me, God confound you!’ Ṣāʿid protested most earnestly – even unbuckling his sword and baldric – that he had done nothing of the sort, but al-Muwaffaq said to him, ‘I want you to go at once to Yūḥannā’s encampment and take the necessary measures to ensure that his affairs are arranged just as he wants them.

                                <p>Ṣo Ṣāʿid set off with Rāshid, accompanied by several of us, myself included. When our party reached the encampment, we found Yūḥannā seated on Sāmān mats in a pavilion that he had had erected. As we approached, Yūḥannā rose to greet Ṣāʿid, Rāshid and me, and invited us all to be seated. Ṣāʿid then repeated to Yūḥannā the same solemn oath that he had sworn to al-Muwaffaq. ‘That’s all very well,’ replied Yūḥannā, ‘but you say one thing and write another; what use is that to me?’ Ṣāʿid swore his oath yet again and urged most solemnly that he had not acted against Yūḥannā’s interests. Calling for a napkin, which was brought and placed in his lap, he took a pen and sheets of paper, and on them wrote and sketched plans confirming Yūḥannā’s titles, in accordance with the physician’s request. He then had Yūḥannā sign in token of acceptance, asked me and the others to sign as witnesses, and sent Rāshid off to al-Muwaffaq bi-Allāh with the whole packet. The result was that Yūḥannā never had to appeal to al-Muwaffaq’s generosity again in any matter.</p>

The first of these is organized on a plan that reflects the arrangement of the parts of the body, from head to feet; it consists of twenty chapters. The second part, which contains six chapters, does not reflect this arrangement.
