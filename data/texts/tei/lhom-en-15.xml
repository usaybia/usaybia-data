It contains sixty entries, starting off with the philosopher Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī and finishing with the physician Abū l-Faraj ibn al-Quff. It is by far the longest chapter of the work and also contains a fair amount of poetry. With the exception of a few entries right at the beginning, the chapter deals with

                        <p>Abū Naṣr Muḥammad ibn Ūzlūgh ibn Ṭarkhān was a native of the town of Fārāb in a Turkish district of Khorasan. His father was an army officer of Persian origin who lived in Baghdad for some time before moving to Damascus, where he remained until his death.</p>
                        <p>Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī – may God have mercy upon him – was a consummate philosopher and a man of learning who was not only well-versed in the philosophic sciences but also excelled in the several domains of mathematics. He was pure of soul and highly intelligent. Moreover, he avoided worldly ambition and was content with the barest subsistence, living like one of the philosophers of antiquity. He was interested in the art of medicine, and was familiar with its general principles, but was not a practising physician, and did not attempt to address specific issues.</p>

                             – may God have mercy upon him – told me that al-Fārābī had once been a keeper of a garden in Damascus. Even then, however, he had always occupied himself with the philosophical sciences, reflecting on them, studying the views of the ancients and elucidating their meanings. He found himself in such straitened circumstances that, when staying up all night to read and write books, he had to use his watchman’s lamp for light. He held that post for some time, but by degrees his situation improved: his merits became manifest and his writings came to be widely read. He acquired many disciples, became a leading authority in the domain of philosophy and was highly regarded. The emir Sayf al-Dawlah Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Ḥamdān al-Taghlibī

                            I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – have copied the following from one of my learned teachers: Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī travelled to Egypt in the year 338/949, returned to Damascus in the month of Rajab of the year 339/950, during the caliphate of al-Rāḍī [bi-Allāh], to stay with Sayf al-Dawlah ʿAlī ibn Ḥamdān. Sayf al-Dawlah recited prayers for him in the presence of fifteen of his closest associates. It is said that of all the presents that were bestowed upon him [by Sayf al-Dawlah], he only accepted four dirhams daily, which he spent on the simple necessities of life. He attached no value whatever to ostentation, luxury or income, and he is said to have subsisted on nothing but a light broth made from lamb’s heart and an aromatic wine.

                                <p>Lothar Kopf’s translation of this fragment is awkward: ‘It is affirmed that he subsisted exclusively on the cardiac fluid of young lambs and seasoned wine’; it is also inappropriate in the sense that it may hint at the human consumption of blood or the execution of some magical procedure.</p>

                        <p>It is said that he was once a judge, but that when he became aware of scientific knowledge, he renounced that occupation and devoted himself exclusively to the study of science. He took no interest in worldly matters: he is said to have left his house at night and visited the watchmen in order to read by the light of their lamps. He was also a student of the art of music and a performing musician, and in that domain too he attained an unsurpassed proficiency. He is said to have made a curious instrument with which he produced extraordinary melodies that would stir his hearers’ emotions. As regards the origin of his interest in philosophy, it is said that a certain man once left the complete works of Aristotle in his keeping. He chanced to look into them, found them congenial, and began to read them, nor did he put them down again until he had mastered them completely and become an accomplished philosopher in his own right.</p>

                                <p>The word ‘philosophy’ is Greek and has been adopted in the Arabic language. The original Greek word is ‘philosophia’, and it means ‘admiration for wisdom’. The term is composed of the words ‘philo’ and ‘sophia’, ‘philo’ meaning admiration and ‘sophia’ wisdom. The word ‘philosopher’ is derived from ‘philosophy’. The Greek term is ‘philosophos’. There are many words that are derived in that way in their language. A ‘philosopher’ is thus an ‘admirer of wisdom’. An ‘admirer of wisdom’ to them is one who makes wisdom his ultimate goal and sole end in life.</p>

                                    The study of philosophy became widespread during the days of the Greek kings. After the death of Aristotle, it was cultivated in Alexandria until the end of the woman’s reign.

                                    Subsequent to Aristotle’s demise, the teaching of the subject there remained unchanged throughout the reign of the thirteen [Ptolemaic] kings, under whom there were twelve successive teachers of philosophy, including one who was known by the name Andronicus [of Rhodes].

                                <p>The last of these rulers was ‘the woman’ [Cleopatra]. Augustus, the emperor of the Romans, defeated and killed her and took possession of her kingdom. Once he had consolidated his rule, he looked through the libraries and reorganized them. There he found manuscripts of the works of Aristotle that dated from the lifetime of the author itself and that of Theophrastus [of Eresos], and he also discovered that later teachers and philosophers had composed works on the subjects which Aristotle discussed in an earlier age. Augustus ordered Andronicus to have copies made of the former, namely, works that were from the times of Aristotle and his disciples, so that they could serve for the teaching of philosophy, while the latter were to be discarded. Augustus said that he would take some of these copies to Rome with him, while others were to be left behind at the School of Alexandria, and he ordered Andronicus to designate a successor in Alexandria and to accompany him to Rome. From then on, philosophy was taught in both cities, and this remained the case until the advent of Christianity.</p>

                                    This put an end to the teaching of philosophy in Rome, but it continued to be pursued in Alexandria until the Christian emperor decided to look into it. The bishops gathered in solemn conclave to consider which parts of the canon should be deemed acceptable and which should be suppressed. In the end, they decided that all the material from the books of logic to the last part of the

                                    Long afterward, after the advent of Islam, the teaching of philosophy migrated from Alexandria to Antioch, where it remained for a very long period. In the end, only one teacher was left. This person taught two men, who left the city and took the books with them. One of these men was a native of Ḥarrān, while the other was a native of Merv.

                                    Both these men settled in Baghdad. Isrāʾīl devoted himself to religion, while Quwayrī began a career in teaching. Yūḥannā ibn Ḥaylān, for his part, applied himself to religion as well. Ibrāhīm al-Marwazī also moved to Baghdad, where one of his students was Mattā ibn Yūnān.

Moreover, he said, Abū Bishr Mattā ibn Yūnān was a contemporary of his. He was older than Abū Naṣr, but Abū Naṣr had a sharper intellect and was more eloquent. Abū Bishr Mattā studied under Ibrāhīm al-Marwazī and died during the caliphate of [the caliph] al-Rāḍī [bi-Allāh], between the years 323/934 and 329/940. Yūḥannā ibn Ḥaylān and Ibrāhīm al-Marwazī had studied under a man from Merv.

                                    Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī (d. 363/974) was a Syrian Orthodox Christian philosopher, theologian and translator, who studied with Abū Bishr Matta ibn Yūnus and Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī. Yaḥyā eventually headed the Aristotelian school in Baghdad. He is particularly well-known for his work on ethical philosophy called

He surpassed all Islamic scholars in that art with the incomparable depth of his knowledge, explaining its obscurities, exploring its secrets and facilitating understanding of it. Al-Fārābī brought together the essential elements of the art of logic in a series of works that provide a sound interpretation of the facts and are written in an intellectually refined style. In those works, he draws attention to those matters that [Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqūb ibn Isḥāq] al-Kindī

                                    Al-Kindī (d. ca. 252/866) was a philosopher, mathematician, physicist, astronomer, physician, geographer and even an expert in music. He made original contributions to all of these fields. On account of his work he became widely known as ‘The Philosopher of the Arabs’; see for instance Atiyeh,

                            and others failed to analyse and elucidate in their teaching. The five methods of logic are clearly set forth, and the author advises the reader on methods of applying and utilizing them, and on the use of analogy with regard to each of them. In a word, his works on that subject are highly rewarding and most erudite.

                            which is highly original, breaking new ground. It is indispensable as a model and an introduction for students of all sciences. In addition, al-Fārābī composed a work on the aims of Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy, which attests his proficiency in philosophy and his knowledge in the various scientific disciplines. This work is essential as a guide to methods of enquiry and procedures of investigation. It affords insight into the secrets and achievements of the several sciences, one by one, and demonstrates how the student can advance gradually from one to another. Beginning with the philosophy of Plato, al-Fārābī identifies its aims and sums up the author’s works in that field. Next, he turns to an exploration of the philosophy of Aristotle, first inserting an important introduction in which he explains how, step by step, he came to appreciate Aristotle’s writings. He, then, describes the aims pursued by Aristotle in his works on logic and physics, book by book, until (according to the copy that has come down to us) he concludes with the beginning of metaphysics and the method of drawing conclusions regarding it through physics. I know of no work that is more advantageous to the student of philosophy, because it explains the concepts common to all sciences while also distinguishing those that are specific to each particular science. Only through this work is it possible for a student to understand the meaning of the categories and to learn about the premises that form the basis of all the sciences.

                            In these works, the author uses the method of Aristotle to explain important parts of metaphysics: the six spiritual elements, how they give rise to the bodily substances, how these elements are arranged, and how they are linked with wisdom. He also presents us with the various categories of men and human psychical faculties, and draws a distinction between revelation and philosophy. In addition, he describes the different types of States, both virtuous and non-virtuous, and shows that every State stands in need of both a temporal ruler and prophetic laws.

When he was asked: ‘Who is the greater [scholar], you or Aristotle?’, he replied: ‘Had I lived in his day I would certainly have been his best disciple’. He is also reported to have said: ‘I have read Aristotle’s

                            was composed by Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī: O God, I ask Thee, the necessarily existent, the cause of all causes, the Sempiternal, who wilt never cease to exist, that Thou preservest me from errors, and makest me place my hope in actions that Thou wilt approve. O God, bestow on me the virtues that Thou hast assembled and bless me in all my affairs. Grant me success in all my goals and quests.

                            O Lord, Thou hast imprisoned my soul in a cell [made out of] the four elements, and Thou hast appointed a beast of prey to kill it because of its desires. O God, grant it protection and be favourably disposed to [my] soul with [Thy] mercy that is most becoming to Thee, and with Thine abundant generosity that befits Thee and is most natural to Thee. Weaken the desires of the soul with penitence, so that the soul can return to the heavenly world. Hasten the soul to return to its sacred place and, over its darkness, let rise a sun of the active intellect. Draw out from it the gloom of ignorance and misguidance, and bring its potential into reality. Bring it out of the darkness of ignorance to the light of wisdom and the bright light of the intellect. God, be near to those who believe and bring them out from the darkness into the light. O God, let my soul become acquainted in my sleep with the forms and shapes of what is virtuous and transcendental, and replace what is confused and muddled in my dreams with visions of good things and glad tidings. Purify my soul from the squalor that affected it through that which is perceptible by the senses and through delusions. Draw out from it the turbidity of nature and let it dwell in the world of the high-ranking souls. God is He who has shown me the right way, made up for my shortcomings and sheltered me.

                                Al-Fārābī began to compose this book in Baghdad, carried it with him to Syria at the end of the year 330/942, and completed and revised it in Damascus in the year 331/942–943. Subsequently, he again looked at the manuscript and inserted the chapter [headings]. Later, someone asked him to add subheadings to indicate the division of subjects, and this he did in Cairo in the year 337/948, dividing the book into six subsections.

                            known as al-Tiflīsī, was a physician who enjoyed great renown during his lifetime. He was a master of the art of medicine and an expert practitioner whose treatments were spectacular. ʿĪsā al-Raqqī was in the service of Sayf al-Dawlah ibn Ḥamdān as one of his [court] physicians.

                                    The Ḥamdānid dynasty was a Shi’ite Muslim Arab dynasty of Northern Iraq and Syria. Sayf al-Dawlah ruled over northern Syria from Aleppo. He became an important opponent of the Byzantine Empire’s (Christian) expansion. His court used to be a centre of culture, thanks to its nurturing of Arabic literature, but it lost its status after the Byzantine conquest of Aleppo. See also

                            ‘I have been informed by a reliable person’, he says, ‘that whenever Sayf al-Dawlah sat down to a meal, twenty-four physicians were present at his table. Some of them received two salaries because they were skilled in two domains, while others were paid triple because they were expert in three. Now, one of these physicians was ʿĪsā al-Raqqī, who was known as al-Tiflīsī. He had a pleasant way with him, and he was the author of a number of medical works and [books on] other subjects. He was also a translator working from Syriac into Arabic. ʿĪsā al-Raqqī was paid four salaries, one for his medical work, one for his translation activities, and the others for his expertise in two other domains’.

See Nasrallah, ‘Abū-l-Faraj al-Yabrūdī’, 13–22; cf. also Monferrer Sala, ‘Al-Yabrūdī.’ The name al-Yabrūdī is derived from Yabrūd, a town some 80 km north of Damascus.</p>

                        <p>Al-Yabrūdī – that is, Abū l-Faraj Jūrjis ibn Yūḥannā ibn Sahl ibn Ibrāhīm – was a Jacobite Christian. He excelled in the art of medicine, being thoroughly acquainted both with its theoretical basis and with its practical application, and was considered one of the most respected and outstanding representatives of that art. He was always busy working, was very fond of studying and held virtue in high esteem.</p>

                             – may God have mercy upon him – told me that al-Yabrūdī was always busy studying and was never weary of it. ‘At all times’, he said, ‘he could be found reading a book’.
                        </p>
                        <p>A Christian of Damascus, the physician al-Sanī al-Baʿlabakkī told me that al-Yabrūdī was born and spent the first years of his life in Yabrūd, a large village near Ṣaydnāyā, where many Christians live. In that village, al-Yabrūdī, like the other Christian inhabitants, engaged in agricultural work and in crop production. He also collected wormwood in an outlying district of Damascus that was near to his home, loaded it on the back of a pack animal, and brought it to the city, where he sold it to be used as fuel for heating baking ovens and other such purposes. One day, as he was coming in through the Tūmā Gate with a load of wormwood, he saw a person whose nose was bleeding profusely being bled by an elderly doctor on the other side of his body, the side opposite the place from which the blood was escaping. He stopped and watched the doctor and then asked him: ‘Why are you bleeding this person, when the quantity of blood escaping from his nose is more than sufficient?’ The doctor replied that he was doing so in order to staunch the flow of blood from the nose by drawing the blood to the side of [the man’s] body opposite the place from which the blood was escaping. ‘Ah?’ said al-Yabrūdī: ‘Where I come from, when we wish to divert a stream, it is our practice to dig an outlet in a new direction, but one that is not directly opposite to that of the old bed. The water then ceases to flow in the old bed and passes into the new one. Why not adopt a similar procedure and bleed from the other side?’ The elderly doctor did so, and the man’s nosebleed stopped. Seeing from al-Yabrūdī’s question that he was keen of understanding, the doctor said, ‘if you devote yourself to the art of medicine, you will become a good physician’.</p>
                        <p>
                            Al-Yabrūdī took his words to heart and became thirsty for knowledge. He returned to the old physician regularly, and the physician taught him a number of treatments. Subsequently, he left Yabrūd and his former life there and moved to Damascus to study the art of medicine. It was not long before he had acquired a first-hand knowledge of that art, mastered scientific principles, treated the sick as best as he could, and observed various diseases, together with their causes and symptoms and the several ways of treating patients. Upon enquiring who was the most outstanding contemporary authority in the matter of knowledge of the art of medicine, he was told that in Baghdad there was a man by the name of Abū l-Faraj ibn al-Ṭayyib,
                            <note n="3" type="footnote">

                                    Abū l-Faraj ibn al-Tayyib (d. 435/1043). Christian (‘Nestorian’) philosopher and physician. He worked at the al-ʿAḍudīyyah hospital in Baghdad and was also the secretary of the Catholicos. See Ullmann,

                            the secretary of the Catholicos, who was a versatile philosopher and an experienced and erudite man in the art of medicine and other branches of science. At once he made preparations for a journey, took a bracelet that had belonged to his mother to pay for his expenses and went to Baghdad. Using the bracelet to provide for his daily needs, he studied under Ibn al-Ṭayyib, until he became proficient in the art of medicine, investigated it at length, and acquired an extensive knowledge of it. He also occupied himself with logic and other philosophical disciplines. Eventually, however, he returned to Damascus, never to leave it again.

It [once] happened that when bleeding a young man, he cut the artery. He became confused and panicky; he attempted to staunch the blood, but was unable to do so. As a crowd gathered, a young boy appeared at his side and said: ‘Uncle, bleed him at the other arm’. Grateful for any advice, the operator bled his patient’s other arm. The boy then said, ‘Bind up the first incision’, and the operator did so, using a bandage that he had about him. When he tightened it, the flow of blood stopped. He then closed the other incision, whereupon the flow of blood was checked and finally ceased altogether.

                                <p>Some time later, the bloodletter saw the same youth driving a pack animal with a load of wormwood. The bloodletter stopped him and said, ‘How did you know what to advise me [to do]?’ ‘I have sometimes seen my father irrigating his vineyard,’ said the youth, ‘when [suddenly] a breach opens in an irrigation channel and the water goes gushing out. My father is not able to stop it only if he makes another opening that will reduce the volume of water pouring out through the breach. Only then can he close the breach’. At this, the surgeon told him to give up selling wormwood, took him under his wing and taught him the art of medicine. Thanks to this incident, al-Yabrūdī became one of the most celebrated and erudite physicians [of his time].</p>

He copied a very large number of medical books personally, including in particular the books of Galen, commentaries on them and compilations of them. Moreover, I have heard from al-Sanī al-Baʿlabakkī that one day al-Yabrūdī was crossing Jayrūn market in Damascus when he saw a person undertake to eat several
                            <hi rend="italic">raṭls</hi>
                            of boiled horse meat, of the quality that is sold in the markets, for a bet. As al-Yabrūdī watched, this person ate far too much, overloading his stomach, and then drank a lot of beer and ice-water, causing his condition to become [severely] perturbed. Al-Yabrūdī then realized that the man would soon lose consciousness, and if left in that condition, he would be in danger of death. He therefore followed the man to his house to see how his condition would develop. A very short time later, his family began to weep and wail, for they thought that he had died. Al-Yabrūdī went to them and said, ‘I shall cure him. There is nothing wrong with him’. Then he brought him to a nearby bathhouse, gently pried his jaws open, and poured some boiled water containing a mild emetic down his throat. This brought on moderate vomiting. Al-Yabrūdī then proceeded to give him supportive treatment, until he regained consciousness and proved to be restored to health. The family were astonished at what he, al-Yabrūdī, had done and [praised] the wonderful way in which he came to the man’s rescue. This affair became well-known and did much to establish his fame. I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say: this story indicates that al-Yabrūdī, by studying the man’s condition and observing what happened to him, had read his symptoms accurately and realized that he could save him if he could treat him in time.

                                    I stayed and watched to see what would happen to him, not because it was my wish to have social intercourse with people of that kind, nor because it was something that I was accustomed to do. God no! But I wanted to see what would happen if a lot of food was forced into his stomach. He ate his carrots while sitting on a wall so that he could see everyone standing around him and was able to jest with them. When he had eaten the greater part of them, I observed that the masticated carrots were coming back into his throat in the form of a stringy, pulpy mass impregnated with saliva. His eyeballs protruded, his breathing stopped, his face turned red, his jugular veins and the veins of his head became engorged with blood, and then his face darkened and turned ashen. He retched more than he vomited, but finally threw up much of what he had eaten. I understood from this that his breathing had stopped because the stomach was pressing the diaphragm towards the mouth and preventing it from returning to its state of expansion for [the purpose of] respiration. As to the fact that his colour reddened and his jugular and [other] veins became engorged with blood, I presumed that this was caused by the natural flow [of the blood] towards the head, as happens to someone whose arm is bandaged for bleeding. In the latter case, the natural flow [of the blood] goes in the direction in which it is stimulated to go. As to the fact that his face subsequently darkened and turned ashen, I must presume that the cause of it was the poor temperament of his heart. If he had not vomited as much as he did, if the stomach had [continued to] press on the diaphragm so that he was prevented from breathing altogether, he would have died of strangulation [asphyxia], as we have seen in many who have died as a result of vomiting. As to the fact that he retched more than he vomited, I understood that the retching was caused by the severity of the disturbance of the stomach.

                                    It thus appears (Ibn Abī l-Ashʿath continues) that when food enters the stomach in large quantities, it causes [the stomach] to stretch and all its folds to expand, as I once saw when dissecting a beast of prey

I then perforated [the stomach], and once the water had come out, the stomach contracted and the folds of the interior returned to their original state, as did the pylorus. As God is my witness, after all this, the animal was still alive.

We examined his face and found that it was bloated, swelling and turning redder and redder, but [all at once] not progressively or gradually. The physician ordered the man to uncover his head and to throw water on it from a pipe that he carried with him. It was the middle of winter and the cold was intense, but the physician stood there until the man had done as he had ordered. He then told him to go home, adding that he would be well advised to follow a mild diet, apply a cooling acidic compress, and cut down on greasy food. In this way, al-Yabrūdī saved him the man from a variety of unpleasant consequences.</p>

                            al-Ṭurṭūshī relates an account told to him by a Syrian about a baker who was making bread in his oven in the city of Damascus, when a man came by, selling apricots. The baker bought some and began to eat them with hot bread. No sooner had he finished than he fell unconscious and appeared to be dead. People flocked around him, brought in physicians and searched for signs and indications of life, but found none, and concluded that he must be dead. He was washed and wrapped in a shroud, prayers were recited, and then the man was carried to the cemetery. As the procession was passing the city gate, it met a physician, a man by the name of al-Yabrūdī who was a skilfull, intelligent and a wise physician. He heard the people discussing the matter and asked them about it. When he had heard what had happened, he said, ‘Put him down so that I can take a look at him’. They put him down, and the physician turned him over, looking for signs of life. He then opened the man’s mouth and made him swallow something (or, according to another account, administered him an enema), whereupon the food he had eaten was [immediately] expelled, so that he was rid of it. The man opened his eyes and spoke, and then returned to his shop. Al-Yabrūdī died in Damascus in the year … [blank] and was buried in the Jacobite church there near the Tūmā Gate.

According to Ibn al-Kattānī’s account, when Abū l-Faraj Jūrjis ibn Yūḥannā al-Yabrūdī died, his estate was found to consist of three hundred Byzantine coins made into a single chalice,

Muwaffaq al-Dīn ibn al-Muṭrān commented, ‘This is not much, because a person who is serious about his work, who is frank, sincere and truth-loving, who acts justly and works hard to learn the skills of his trade, has a right before God to his earnings. A person who is the opposite of this will live like a pauper and will die as a lost and desperate person’.

He was a man of many accomplishments and was well-acquainted with literature. Moreover, he was thoroughly familiar with the sciences and devoted himself to them assiduously. In Baghdad he made the acquaintance of Abū l-Faraj ibn al-Ṭayyib, associated with him and studied under him. Ẓāfir ibn Jābir, like his father before him, had a very long life. He was still living in the year 482/1089. He was a native of Mosul, but left that city and moved to Aleppo, where he remained for the rest of his life. A number of his offspring followed in his footsteps as physicians in Aleppo. The following is a sample of his poetry:

He loved play-acting,

                            Abū l-Ḥakam would compose defamatory poems against a group of contemporary poets, who, in turn, had ridiculed him in satiric verse. One of them, Abū l-Nadā Ḥassān ibn Numayr al-Kalbī, known as al-ʿArqalah, lampooned Abū l-Ḥakam in the following satirical verses:

                        </p>
                        <p>Abū l-Majd lived during the reign of the Sultan al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn Maḥmūd ibn Zangī – may God have mercy upon him – who had great regard for him, held him in high esteem and recognized his extensive knowledge and virtue. When al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn founded the great hospital, he put Abū l-Majd in charge of the medical college, granting him with a salary and allowances. He would visit [the hospital] frequently and treat the patients in it. Shams al-Dīn Abū l-Faḍl ibn Abī l-Faraj, the oculist, who was known as al-Miṭwāʿ (‘The Obedient’) – may God have mercy upon him – told me that he had seen Abū l-Majd ibn Abī l-Ḥakam at the hospital, making his rounds, seeing the patients, examining their conditions and determining the importance of their cases. He would be accompanied by the overseers [of the wards] and the superintendents, who would immediately, without hesitation, execute his orders concerning the treatment of each patient and the management of the cases. After finishing with all this, Abū l-Majd would go to the castle and visit any state dignitaries who might happen to be indisposed. Finally, he would go and sit in the great hall of the hospital, which was abundantly furnished and carpeted, and engage in study; for Nūr al-Dīn – may God have mercy upon him – had donated a large number of medical works to the hospital, and these were kept in cupboards in the wall at the rear of that hall. Physicians and students [of medicine] would come there to Abū l-Majd and sit before him to discuss medical matters. He [also] taught his students [there] and would engage in discussion and study with them. After three hours with his books, he would make his way home. Abū l-Majd ibn Abī l-Ḥakam died in Damascus in the year 5[..]/11[..].</p>

                        <p>
                            Ibn al-Budhūkh resided in Damascus for many years. He had an apothecary shop in The Feltmakers’ Market (

                            ), where he treated both without notice and by appointment. He prepared many compound drugs, which he made of various kinds of electuaries, pastilles, powders, and the like. These he sold, much to the benefit of the population.

                        <p>
                            Ibn al-Budhūkh was interested in books on medicine, reading them carefully to find out what the ancients had said about the characteristics and the treatment of diseases. He wrote a commentary on a number of words and passages in

                        <p>Ibn al-Budhūkh lived a long life, but in old age his ability to walk weakened to such an extent that he could no longer go to his shop unless he was carried there on a litter. Toward the end of his life he became blind from cataracts. This was caused by [the fact] that he had nourished himself with large amounts of milk in order to regulate his bodily humours. He died in Damascus in the year 575 or 576 [1179 or 1180].</p>

                            Ḥakīm al-Zamān Abū l-Faḍl ʿAbd al-Munʿim ibn ʿUmar ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Ḥassān al-Ghassānī al-Andalusī al-Jilyānī was [one of] the outstanding personalities of his time [in his capacity] as a practitioner of both the art of medicine and ophthalmology. He was skilled in literature and the art of poetry and composed figurative poems. He was a native of Andalusia, but migrated to Damascus, in Syria, where he lived for the remainder of his very long life. Ḥakīm al-Zamān kept a shop in The Feltmakers’ Market (
                            <hi rend="italic">al-Labbādīn</hi>
                            ) where he practised medicine. Al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb [i.e. Saladin] had a good opinion of him and showed him great respect. In return Ḥakīm al-Zamān composed many figurative poems for him, He also wrote books for [his ruler], receiving in consequence many benefits and tokens of appreciation. Moreover, Ḥakīm al-Zamān ʿAbd al-Munʿim was interested in alchemy.

                        <p>When he died in Damascus in the year 600/1203–1204, Ḥakīm al-Zamān ʿAbd al-Munʿim left a son named ʿAbd al-Muʾmin ibn ʿAbd al-Munʿim. The son was an oculist as well. The latter also wrote poetry and composed figurative poems He was oculist to al-Malik al-Ashraf Abū l-Fatḥ Mūsā ibn al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr ibn Ayyūb, and died in Edessa in the 620s/1220s or shortly thereafter.</p>

                            The following is an example of the poetry of Ḥakīm al-Zamān ʿAbd al-Munʿim al-Jilyānī, which I have copied from a manuscript in his own handwriting. I also heard it from my father who said: ‘the physician ʿAbd al-Muʾmin, who had had it from his celebrated father ʿAbd al-Munʿim, recited [this verse] to me’. It was composed to extol [the virtues of] Al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Abū l-Muẓaffar Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb [i.e. Saladin]. It was sent to him from the city of Damascus to his camp, al-Manṣūr, on the outskirts of Acre, when he was besieging the Franks who were themselves besieging the city. The

                                    . The poem was composed at a time when Saladin had to cope with the arrival of the forces of the Third Crusade and the ensuing siege of ʿAkkā (Acre, Akko), which had been taken by Saladin in 1187 but fell to the Franks in July 1191. The poem refers to several battles and naval encounters.

He was singularly esteemed in his time in the art of medicine, and held a salon where physicians gathered. Once he travelled to Egypt and stayed for some time in Cairo, but afterwards he returned to Damascus and remained there until his death. He served as physician to al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn Maḥmūd ibn Zangī, who respected him greatly. In addition, possessing as he did a good epistolary style, he handled much of Nūr al-Dīn’s correspondence with regional officials.</p>

                        <p>Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ibn al-Naqqāsh sent the oil as requested. He remained in the service of Nūr al-Dīn, until [the latter] died – may God have mercy upon him – in Damascus [in the month of] Shawwāl of the year 569 [May 1174]. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ibn al-Naqqāsh subsequently entered the service of al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb [i.e. Saladin], when the latter took control of Damascus. As Saladin’s physician, he enjoyed [the ruler’s] favour. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ibn al-Naqqāsh was a very kind man who performed many good deeds. He was a private person, and did not marry or leave offspring.

Upon arriving in Egypt from the West, he stayed in Cairo for some time and then went to Damascus where he settled. He studied under Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Abī l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn ʿAlī ibn Hibat Allāh, who was known as Ibn al-Naqqāsh al-Baghdādī,

                        <p>Sukkarah was a Jewish elder from the city of Aleppo, a small man, but a skilled medical practitioner, with a long experience in the care of patients. I have heard the following account from the shaykh Ṣafī al-Dīn Khalīl ibn Abī l-Faḍl ibn Manṣūr al-Tanūkhī, the scribe of Latakiyah, ‘[When] Al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn Maḥmūd ibn Zangī was in Aleppo, he kept with him in the citadel a concubine of whom he was particularly fond. This girl once became seriously ill. Al-Malik al-ʿĀdil had to go to Damascus, but his heart remained with her, and he sent constantly to enquire about her. Her illness persisted, although she received medical treatment from some of the most distinguished physicians. Finally, however, the wise doctor Sukkarah was brought to her. He found that she had very little appetite, had a humoral imbalance, and was not able to move and rise from her bed. He returned to her several times with the other physicians and eventually asked permission to visit her alone.</p>
                        <p>
                            Once closeted with his patient, Sukkarah said to her, “My lady, I can give you a treatment which, God willing, will cause you to recover as quickly as possible, so that you will have no need of anything else”. She replied: “Please do so!” At this, he said: “I want you to answer whatever questions I pose to you, and to tell me [everything] without hiding [any] facts from me”. She promised to do so, and in return, at his request, assured him that no harm would befall him. Then he asked: “Where are you from?” “I am one of the Alans,” she replied.

                                    The Alans (unusually spelled al-ʿAlān instead of the normal al-Lān) were an Iranian people of the western Eurasian steppes and North. Some of them were idolaters, whereas others followed the Islamic faith. However, the majority of them were Christians. See

                            “The Alans in their homeland are Christians,” said the physician. “Tell me, what did you usually eat at home?”. “Cow’s meat,” she replied. “And what kind of wine did you drink there, my lady?” he asked. “Such and such,” she replied. “Excellent! For then you will be all right!,” said the physician, and took his leave.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sukkarah went back to his house, bought a calf, slaughtered it and cooked a part of it. He [then] returned to the citadel, carrying with him a bowl containing a piece of boiled meat marinated in milk and garlic and topped with a thin slice of bread. This he placed in front of the girl, saying, “Eat”. She leaned over to it and began to dip [the bread] in the milk and garlic and ate until she was full. The physician then took a small vessel from his sleeve and said, “My lady, this is a drink that will do you good. Take it!” No sooner had she drunk it than she became sleepy. He covered her with a mantle made of squirrel fur, which caused her to perspire heavily, but when she awoke the next morning, she felt well. Subsequently, al-Ḥalabī gave her [the same] food and drink on the following two days, until her health was fully restored.</p>
                        <p>The girl treated the physician most generously, giving him a tray filled with pieces of jewellery. He thanked her, but added, “Nevertheless I would like you to write a letter for me to the sultan, informing him about the nature of your illness and explaining that you were cured by me”. She promised to do so, and was as good as her word: she wrote to the Sultan, telling him how grateful she was to the physician, stating that she had been on the verge of death and had been treated by so-and-so, who was the only person who proved able to cure her, while all the other physicians who came to see her had been baffled by her illness, and asking [the sultan] to reward him.</p>
                        <p>
                            When [the sultan] read the letter, he sent for Sukkarah, showed him great honour and said to him, “We are grateful to you for your treatment”. “My Lord,” replied the physician, “she was near perishing, but God mighty and glorious granted her health through me for as much time as may remain to her”. The sultan nodded in approval and said: “Ask whatever you want, and I shall give it to you”. “My Lord,” replied the physician, “grant me ten

                            summoned him, along with a number of distinguished scholars, jurists and theologians, so that he could listen to them debating and discussing [all different kinds of subjects]. They held a long debate, in which he [Shihāb al-Dīn] displayed effortless superiority over the others, and dazzled everyone with his great knowledge. He made a good impression on al-Malik al-Ẓāhir, thereby acquiring rank and prestige.

                            However, the respect and favour shown al-Suhrawardī by al-Malik al-Ẓāhir merely inflamed the hatred of his rivals, who [then] prepared attested statements alleging that he was an infidel and sent them to the Sultan al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn in Damascus. “If this [man] stays”, they wrote, “he will corrupt the faith of al-Malik al-Ẓāhir; if he is set free and sent away, he will corrupt any region of the country in which he settles,” together with many remarks of the same kind. Upon receiving this letter, Saladin had his scribe, al-Qāḍī al-Fāḍil,

                            draft a letter concerning the matter and send it to his son, al-Malik al-Ẓāhir, in Aleppo. In the letter, Saladin wrote that this Shihāb al-Suhrawardī surely had to be killed, for he could neither be sent elsewhere nor, under any circumstances, allowed to stay where he was. When Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī heard of this, he realized that he must die and that there was no way for him to escape [his fate]. Accordingly, he chose to be left in an isolated place and be denied food and drink until he should meet God, exalted be He. This happened at the end of the year 586/1190 in the citadel of Aleppo, when he was about thirty-six years old’. The shaykh Sadīd al-Dīn Maḥmūd ibn ʿUmar commented on this by saying: ‘When the news about his death reached our shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn al-Māridīnī, he said to us: “Did I not tell you so before, did I not fear for him?” ’

These were visible in a ditch several meters below the present street level. The civil war in Syria and specifically the heavy shelling and bombardments in Aleppo may already have caused all of this to disappear forever. See Tabbaa,

They were either singers and flute-players or owners of public houses and inns in which vulgar amusement ran rampant’. ʿAbd al-Laṭīf al-Baghdādī, moreover, accuses one of Suhrawardī’s direct companions, an emir of the Seljuqs of Rūm, of mutilating the bodies of dead Frankish soldiers for the sole purpose of using their body parts in alchemistic procedures, see Joosse,

                                    We looked and saw in the direction of the east lofty whitewashed palaces built closely together, constructed and ornamented in a most beautiful manner. The enclosure contained large windows, in which the most beautiful women imaginable [could be seen]. Singing voices and musical instruments were heard. There were intertwining trees and broad rivers were flowing [there]. We had not known this place before and were greatly astonished at it. The crowd was delighted at the view, but [at the same time] perplexed by what they saw. The physician Ibrāhīm goes on: ‘We continued to see it for an hour, but then it vanished and we again viewed what we had long been accustomed to see [there]’. He said to me: ‘But when I first gazed at this wondrous manifestation, it felt as if I had quietly dozed off [without anyone noticing it]. My perception [of things] did not seem to be in touch with reality’.

We said to the shaykh: ‘O master, we would like to eat one of those sheep’. ‘I have ten dirhams,’ replied Shihāb al-Dīn, ‘take them and buy yourself a sheep.’ So with the money we bought a sheep from the Turkmen. We walked on, but were overtaken by the shepherd’s companion, who said: ‘Give back that sheep and take a smaller one, because that man did not know what he was selling you. That animal of the size of a Bactrian camel that you (now) have is worth far more than the price he got from you’.

The Turkmen came after him shouting, but he paid no attention and did not speak to him. When the Turkmen caught up with him, he grabbed his left arm in a fury and cried: ‘Where are you going and why did you walk away from me?’ Suddenly the shaykh’s arm [lit. hand] came off his shoulder. The Turkmen found himself holding it in his hand, with blood pouring out from it. The Turkmen turned pale, stood in bewilderment, and threw away the arm, filled with fear. The shaykh returned, picked up the arm with his right hand and rejoined us. The Turkmen kept on looking around at us until he was out of sight. When the shaykh reached us, we saw nothing but a handkerchief in his right hand.

The offers he received eventually reached the amount of twenty-five thousand dirhams.

The intendant said: ‘Let me first inform Iftikhār al-Dīn’s son of that offer.’ He took the stone, went back to the market, returned it to Iftikhār al-Dīn’s son and said: ‘Go and consult your father about the price that has been offered,’ since the intendant was under the impression that the stone belonged to Iftikhār al-Dīn. When Iftikhār al-Dīn’s son came to Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī and informed him of the price that had been offered for the stone, he was shocked. He took the jewel, placed it on a large stone, and then smashed it with another large stone until it was broken into tiny fragments, saying to Iftikhār al-Dīn’s son: ‘O my son, take these clothes, go back to your father, kiss his hand for me, and say to him: “If I had wanted the clothes, the price would have been fair.” ’

The director [of the college] informed him that it belonged to a poor man, who was staying with him. The Sultan thought this over and said: ‘O Iftikhār al-Dīn, if my conjecture is right, that man is Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī.’ The Sultan then rose to his feet, met Shihāb al-Dīn, took him to the citadel, where he enjoyed great favour. He would engage in discussions with jurists from all schools (

It is said that al-Malik al-Ẓāhir sent out someone to strangle him. Later, however, the Sultan took vengeance on those who had issued the fatal legal opinion that had brought about al-Suhrawardī’s death. He seized a number of them, put them under arrest, humiliated them and confiscated a large part of their possessions.</p>

                                    This is the reading of Müller. However, manuscript A has the following reading: ‘His master was Quṭb al-Dīn al-Miṣrī, the disciple of Imam Fakhr al-Dīn’. Shams al-Dīn al-Khuwayyī lived from 583/1187 to 637/1240. Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī lived from ca. 544/1150 to 606/1210. The well-known scholar Naṣīr al-Dīn Ṭūsī (597–672/1201–1274) studied as a young boy under Quṭb al-Dīn al-Miṣrī and Farīd al-Dīn Dāmādh in Nishapur (
                                    <hi rend="italic">Nīsābūr</hi>
                                    ) somewhere between 610/1213 and 618/1221. See for this information Van Lit,

He remained very humble, was soft-spoken, went to the mosque on foot and punctually attended all the prayers. His literary works are outstanding and unequalled.

                            Rafīʿ al-Dīn served as a judge for a short while in the city of Baalbek, where he was a close friend of the vizier Amīn al-Dawlah.

                            had become the ruler of Damascus, when the chief judge Shams al-Dīn al-Khuwayyī died, may God have mercy upon him, Amīn al-Dawlah suggested that Rafīʿ al-Dīn al-Jīlī should take his place. Accordingly, the Sultan appointed him to the post of chief judge in Damascus thereby enabling him to enjoy great prestige and wealth.

                            As time went on, however, many people complained about him and had serious misgivings about his conduct. To make a long story short, in the end he was arrested and put to death – may God have mercy upon him – during the reign of al-Malik Ṣāliḥ Ismāʿīl. Following an argument between the Rafīʿ al-Dīn and the vizier Amīn al-Dawlah, the judge was placed under guard and brought, under an escort of the vizier’s men, to a place near Baalbek, where there was an immense reputedly bottomless pit, known as the Cave of Afqah.

                            These men were ordered to tie his hands and then push him into the pit. One of the men who was among those present on that occasion told me that when Rafīʿ al-Dīn was pushed into this pit, he was crushed by the fall, but that his clothing appeared to have caught on the side of the cave near the bottom. ‘We stayed there for approximately three days,’ he told me ‘listening to his moaning and groaning. After some time, it became weaker and weaker and then it stopped, so that we were sure that he was dead. Then we went away’.

                            He looked through it, but stopped when he had finished [reading] the account of Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī. He was much impressed by it and spoke: ‘You have included him, but you have omitted others who were greater than he’, referring to himself. Then he added, ‘Shihāb al-Dīn’s situation was most unfortunate indeed, but at least he died in the end. And God mighty and glorious decreed that Rafīʿ al-Dīn should be put to death like him. Praise the Lord, who determines [the fate of] His creatures according to His will’. The judge Rafīʿ al-Dīn died in the month of Dhū l-Ḥijjah of the year 641 [May 1244]. When Rafīʿ al-Dīn became judge in Damascus and was appointed as chief judge in 638/1240, I composed the following poem to congratulate him on that occasion:

                                    Khusrawshāh is a hamlet west of the city of Tabrīz in Persia. Its present name is Khosrow Shahr, cf. also Yāqūt,

                            was a leading scholar, an outstanding philosopher, a model to mankind and an honour to Islam. He distinguished himself in the philosophical sciences, was devoted to the principles of medicine and was well-versed in religious law. Tireless in the pursuit of learning, and a man of great merit and virtue, he was one of the most brilliant disciples of the shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn, the ‘Son of the Preacher of al-Rayy’ [that is, Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī].

                            He was held in high esteem [by the Sultan], who showed him great favour and bestowed many gifts upon him. Shams al-Dīn went to Damascus where he resided until he died – may God have mercy upon him – in the month of Shawwāl of the year 652 [October-November 1254]. He was buried on Mount Qāsiyūn.

                            When Shams al-Dīn arrived in Damascus, and I met him, I found him to be an elderly gentleman with pleasant manners and an attractive way of speaking. He was intelligent and very learned. One day when I was at his home a Persian jurist brought him a book written in a very tiny handwriting, one-eighth the size of Baghdadi script, and in a rather irregular format.

                            After looking at it and [thoroughly] examining it, he kissed it and laid it down forthwith. Upon my asking him the reason for this, he said, ‘This is the handwriting of our master, the Imam Fakhr al-Dīn, the preacher – may God have mercy upon him’. I felt great esteem for him because of the respect that he had shown toward his master. When Shams al-Dīn al-Khusrawshāhī died – may God have mercy upon him – the shaykh ʿIzz al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan al-Ghanawī al-Ḍarīr al-Irbilī celebrated him in an elegy:

                            showered acts of kindness upon him, honoured him greatly and appointed him professor at a [law] college. When he came to the college and began to give lectures and hold classes there for the jurists, everyone was astonished at his excellent qualities in debate and research. There was no one who was equal to him in any of the sciences, but he rarely taught any of the philosophical sciences.

                        <p>I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – used to meet with him and study the ‘Book of the Indication of Treasures’ under him, which he had composed himself. This was because of the firm friendship between him and my father. The first time I met him, I had come to his house with my father. He lived in a paved courtyard near the al-Ādiliyyah law college in Damascus. After we had greeted him, he observed the formalities by welcoming us with amiable words. Then we sat down. He looked at us and spoke these [exact] words: ‘I have never seen a father and a son resemble each other more than you do’.</p>

                            The learned and virtuous physician and leading authority Muwaffaq al-Dīn Abū Naṣr Asʿad ibn Abī l-Fatḥ Ilyās ibn Jurjis al-Muṭrān was a leading philosopher and a most erudite scholar. He was amply blessed and richly favoured (by God) and was the leading expert of his time in the theory and practise of medicine, having been peerless in the knowledge and application of its principles, and a gentle and outstanding practitioner. He was an expert in the philosophical sciences. In addition, he was devoted to the writerly culture. He studied grammar, lexicography and literature under the teacher and well-known authority Tāj al-Dīn Abī l-Yumn Zayd ibn al-Ḥasan al-Kindī

                                    ). Shaykh Tāj al-Dīn was also one of the teachers of the famous polymath ʿAbd al-Laṭīf al-Baghdādī. The latter portrayed him as ‘a fine-looking shaykh, with a keen wit, wealthy, and in great favour with the sultan, but very self-satisfied and troublesome to his associates’ (trans. Gibb in Saunders,

                                    , 72). ʿAbd al-Laṭīf and Tāj al-Dīn had some arguments together. In the end, ʿAbd al-Laṭīf neglected to attend his lessons, which annoyed Tāj al-Dīn enormously. See Martini Bonadeo, ‘Philosophical journey,’ 125–126; Toorawa, ‘A Portrait’, 102. Shaykh Tāj al-Dīn viciously compared ʿAbd al-Laṭīf to a pancake because of his slender figure.

                            Muwaffaq al-Dīn ibn al-Muṭrān was Damascus born and bred. His father was also a prominent physician, who travelled to foreign lands in search of enlightenment. He had travelled to Byzantium in order to acquaint himself thoroughly with the principles of Christianity (being himself a Christian) and the several schools of Christian thought.

                            Ibn al-Muṭrān was a handsome man, who was particularly fond of luxurious, costly clothes. He served as a physician to al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb (Saladin) who showed him great favour, with the result that he enjoyed high status and great prestige. The ruler made him his chamberlain and appointed him in charge of the household, a post for which he paid him extremely well. Saladin – may God have mercy upon him – was a noble and excellent man, who was very generous to those who served him and to everyone who asked his for assistance, so much so that when he died, his treasury was found to be empty. He had complete confidence in Ibn al-Muṭrān, never leaving him behind whenever he was travelling or [whenever he] decided to stay in some town or village. For that reason, he [constantly] showered the physician with favours and gifts and provided him with opulent means. Ibn al-Muṭrān [then] became proud and arrogant, thinking himself even above kings. Saladin was aware of this trait in him, but did not cease to show him respect and esteem, because he admired him for his [great] knowledge.

                        <p>Someone who knew Ibn al-Muṭrān’s conceited nature and arrogance well told me that he once accompanied the Sultan on one of his military expeditions. In time of war, during campaigns, it was Saladin’s habit to occupy a red pavilion, complete with a red outer tent and vestibule. One day, when Saladin was out riding, he saw a red tent with a red vestibule and privy. He contemplated it for a while and then asked whose it was. Upon being informed that it belonged to the physician Ibn al-Muṭrān, he said, ‘By God, I knew it was some stupid freak of Ibn al-Muṭrān’s!’ He laughed, but then said, ‘What would happen if a messenger were to ride by and think that it belonged to a king? If he must have his tent, he shall [at least] change the privy,’ and he ordered it to be destroyed. When this was done, Ibn al-Muṭrān took it very hard, keeping to himself for two days and not providing his usual services, but the Sultan mollified him with a gift of a purse.</p>

                            who served the Sultan for a time and frequently visited his palace. One day he told the Sultan that he needed dowries for his daughters and asked him for his assistance in this matter. Saladin replied, ‘Write down on paper everything that you require for their dowries and bring it to me’. Abū l-Faraj left and listed on a piece of paper jewellery, fabrics, utensils and other things to the value of thirty thousand dirhams. When Saladin read the list, he ordered his treasurer [

                            ] to buy everything that was included in it for Abū l-Faraj, leaving nothing out. No sooner had Ibn al-Muṭrān heard about this than his attendances on his master became surly and sporadic. Saladin noticed that his physician’s face had changed and he understood the reason for it. Then and there he ordered his treasurer to make a note of everything that he had bought for Abū l-Faraj, the physician, and to calculate the total price of it. When the treasurer had calculated the total amount, Saladin ordered him to pay Ibn al-Muṭrān a similar sum, and that was duly done.

                        <p>Abū l-Ẓāhir Ismāʿīl, who knew Ibn al-Muṭrān and was on intimate terms with him, told me that the vanity and the arrogance that became characteristic of him [later on in life], were entirely absent during his days as a young man in search of knowledge. He said that he used to see Ibn al-Muṭrān when the latter was studying grammar at the mosque. He would come there after he had finished his work at the Sultan’s palace. He would arrive with an escort of horsemen, accompanied by numerous Turkish slaves and others. When he approached the mosque, he would [dismount and] continue on foot, holding his books in his hand or under his arm. He would let none of the servants accompany him, but would walk, with the books, to the study-circle of the shaykh under whom he was studying. He would then greet him [the shaykh] and sit among the group, alert and receptive, until the lesson was over and he returned to his attendants.</p>

                            the physician Muwaffaq al-Dīn Asʿad ibn al-Muṭrān, a Christian, became a good Muslim after his conversion to Islam. Al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn – may God sanctify his soul – presented him with one of his favourite ladies at the palace, named Jawzah, as a wife. Jawzah was a servant of Khwand Khātūn, the daughter of Muʿīn al-Dīn and the wife of Saladin. It was Jawzah who managed the household and was her mistress’ favourite handmaid. Khwand Khātūn gave her many pieces of jewellery and other precious articles, making her a rich [woman], and made her the recipient of many acts of favour. Jawzah put Ibn al-Muṭrān’s affairs into proper order, taught him how to behave, improved his manner of dressing and embellished both his outer appearance and his character. He earned a reputation that quickly spread throughout the country, and acquired great wealth by treating state dignitaries when they fell ill: they vied with each other in offering him gifts and presents. His position with the Sultan was so important that he almost had the status of a vizier. He used to take men who specialized in medicine and philosophy under his protection, in order to advance their interests, and acted as an intermediary in helping them to earn a living.

                            I brought it with me to Damascus, where the Sultan was staying, but I was advised to show it to Ibn al-Muṭrān. I went to his house, entered with his permission, and found him a pleasant and good-natured man and a good listener and talker. His house struck me as extremely beautiful with respect to its construction and furnishings. I saw water spouting from pipes in his pond that were made of pure gold and were of the most excellent craftsmanship. I [also] saw a young and exceptionally handsome lad, who waited on him hand and foot, called ʿUmar.

They had come to Aleppo after the year 600/1203, in straitened circumstances, but were shown hospitality under the protection of al-Malik al-Ẓāhir – may God prosper his reign – and lived on charitable allowances that had been allocated to them. After a time, she died, and I have not heard anything further about the son of ʿUmar since’.

When they arrived at the prince’s abode, Ibn al-Muṭrān said to the prince, ‘This is a distinguished physician and I have complete confidence in his knowledge of the art of medicine. I trust him, so let him keep you company and attend to your condition at all times. Let him stay with you until you recover, God willing’. The prince agreed to this suggestion, and the physician Yaʿqūb stayed with him day and night until he regained health, for which he was rewarded with five hundred dinars. Upon receiving this sum of money, Yaʿqūb went to Ibn al-Muṭrān and said to him, ‘O master, the prince has given this to me, and I am bringing you the money he gave me’. Ibn al-Muṭrān replied, ‘Keep it, for I only intended to benefit you’. Yaʿqūb kept it, invoking God’s blessing upon Ibn al-Muṭrān.

On his way out, he was approached by one of Ibn al-Muṭrān’s servants, who gave him a bundle containing a few items of clothing, together with a horse, a saddle and a bridle. ‘Take these clothes and put them on,’ said the servant, ‘mount the horse and prepare to go to Ṣarkhad’. ‘But I have nowhere to leave the horse for the night,’ protested the young man. ‘Leave the horse with us,’ the servant replied, ‘saddle it early tomorrow morning and go with God, the exalted’.

There is no need for you to leave Ṣarkhad’. They had an exchange of words, and upon being further pressed, the youth finally said, ‘I simply must go to my house first, and then I will return’. He went home, fetched the robe of honour, the gold and the rest, and brought it all back to ʿIzz al-Dīn. ‘This is what you have given me,’ he said. ‘Take it back, for by God, I know nothing at all about the art of medicine. I only spoke for a while with the physician Ibn al-Muṭrān. That’s all!’ And he told ʿIzz al-Dīn exactly what had happened. ‘Do not worry about it,’ said ʿIzz al-Dīn, ‘and stop talking about it, you do not have to be a physician. Do you know how to play backgammon and chess?’ The youth exclaimed, ‘But of course!’, for he was cultured and refined. ‘Well,’ said ʿIzz al-Dīn, ‘I will make you my chamberlain and grant you lands that will provide you with twenty-two thousand dirhams yearly’. ‘I am at your service, O master,’ the youth replied, ‘but should like to ask permission to go to Damascus and see the physician Ibn al-Muṭrān, so that I may kiss his hand and thank him for all the good that he has done to me,’ and ʿIzz al-Dīn gave him permission to go.</p>

Then the youth told Muwaffaq al-Dīn about his dealings with ʿIzz al-Dīn and the position that he had been offered. The youth returned to Ṣarkhad and entered the service of ʿIzz al-Dīn. All the good things that had happened to him were due to the generosity of Muwaffaq al-Dīn ibn al-Muṭrān.</p>

                            I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say: Muwaffaq al-Dīn ibn al-Muṭrān was a zealous collector of books. When he died, approximately ten thousand medical and other works were found in his library, apart from those he had copied. He took a keen interest in copying and revising books, and there were three copyists in his service who were constantly transcribing books for him, and who received payment and allowances from him. One of them was Jamāl al-Dīn (also known as Ibn al-Jammālah),

Ibn al-Muṭrān copied many books in his own handwriting; I have seen several examples of these, and they were unsurpassable as to script and grammatical correctness. He read many books and, in fact, spent most of his time reading. A majority of the books found in his library contain corrections and very precise revisions in his handwriting. Ibn al-Muṭrān had the utmost regard for books with a watchful eye for any errors therein. Most of the small books and miscellaneous items in the domain of medicine, which were found [in his library], had been combined into single volumes. He had them all copied on small-format paper, one-sixteenth the size of Baghdādī paper,

He would never leave his house without a book in his sleeve, which he would read at the gate of the Sultan’s palace or wherever else he might go. After his death, all his books were sold, because he did not leave behind offspring.

He informed me that he had reached an agreement with the heirs concerning the sale, to the effect that they would sell each item for one dirham, and [some of] the [other] physicians [also] purchased these small-format books at that price.

                            I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – comment: Ibn al-Muṭrān possessed the complete ideal of manhood and was a noble soul. He was kind toward his disciples and gave them books as presents. When one of them began to [practise medicine and] heal the sick, Ibn al-Muṭrān would give him a robe of honour and devote his complete and constant attention to him.

He asked Ibn al-Muṭrān what [drugs] he should take to cure his disease. But the physician, distressed at the sight of the man said, “Eat viper’s flesh”. The man repeated his question, but Ibn al Muṭran said again, “Eat viper’s flesh, and you shall recover”. We went on to Homs, where Ibn al-Muṭrān treated the patient for whose sake he had come, until he recovered and felt well again. We then returned to Damascus. When we were on our way, a handsome young man who looked perfectly healthy, approached and greeted us. He kissed Ibn al-Muṭrān’s hand, but the physician did not recognize him, and asked, “Who are you?” The youth introduced himself as the one who had asked him about a treatment for leprosy. He had followed Ibn al-Muṭrān’s advice and had recovered without any need of any other remedy. He then bade us farewell and went his way, leaving us marvelling at the completeness of his recovery.’

When he realized that the patient was not strong enough to withstand the removal of more fluid, he had the site dressed and the patient laid [on his bed], ordering that the dressing should not be disturbed. The patient then felt greatly relieved and was able to relax. The patient’s wife was with him [at the hospital], and Ibn al-Muṭrān urged her not to allow her husband to remove the dressing or to change it in any way until he could examine the patient the next day. We then left the hospital. When night came the man said to his wife: ‘I am well now, there is nothing wrong with me; those physicians only intent to prolong my illness. So, undo the dressing so that the rest of the fluid comes out and I can return to work’. She reproached him and said it would be a mistake, but he repeated his request over and over again, not realizing that [the doctors] wanted to extract the fluid at a later stage, as a protective measure, in order to preserve his strength, because they were concerned about his condition. Finally, she undid the dressing, all the fluid ran out, his strength gave out and he perished.</p>

                            of the year 587 [April 1191]. I have copied a eulogy in honour of Muwaffaq al-Dīn ibn al-Muṭrān, composed after his conversion to Islam on the third of the month Ramadan of the year 585 [24–25 October 1189], in the handwriting of the poet al-Badīʿ ʿAbd al-Razzāq ibn Aḥmad al-ʿĀmirī.

That the interpretation of the line was problematic is attested by the different versions found in the editions by Müller, Najjār, and Riḍā.

However, he did not compose panegyrical verse that could inspire generosity; a more likely candidate is the famous Abbasid court poet al-Buḥturī (d. 184/897), whose

His identity is unknown. Al-Bandahī is an Arabicised form deriving from Persian Panj-dih (‘Five villages’) in Khorasan. The only person with this name found in the sources is Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Masʿūdī al-Bandahī (d. 584/1188), a scholar and philologist, tutor of one of Saladin’s sons and author of a commentary on al-Ḥarīrī’s

                                ). [Its author] attempted [in this book] to collect all the witty sayings, anecdotes and appropriate information that he had read or heard from his teachers, or that he copied from [other] medical books. He did not finish this book. All I found of it were two parts, written in the hand of our teacher, the physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn. The first of these had been [proof]read by Ibn al-Muṭrān and contained his handwriting. In the second part, however, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn makes mention of the fact that Ibn al-Muṭrān died before he was able to [proof]read it.

I have found the original of this book, which is transmitted in the handwriting of Jamāl al-Dīn, also known as Ibn Jammālah, the scribe of Ibn al-Muṭrān.

Before he became well-known as a physician, he worked on the clocks at the mosque in Damascus. He went on to distinguished himself in the art of medicine and became one of the most prominent men in that profession, serving as a physician at the ‘Great Hospital’, founded by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn ibn Zangī. Subsequently, Ibn al-Ḥājib entered the service of Taqī al-Dīn ʿUmar, ruler of Hama,

He was of noble descent, had high moral standards, a pleasant character, and possessed many other excellent qualities. In addition, he was an expert oculist, very knowledgeable and erudite, well-versed in the literary arts, a distinguished [scholar] in the domain of Arabic studies and an outstanding writer and leading poet. Al-Sharīf al-Kaḥḥāl served al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb as an oculist, receiving in return splendid rewards, great prestige and many favours and graces. He held this important position [in the Sultan’s service] until he died – may God have mercy upon him.

Ibn al-Faḍl literally means ‘son of al-Faḍl’; it is possible that his father was called al-Faḍl even though, unusually, this is not stated explicitly in the entry on him. In Yāqūt,

The origin of its name derives from the Aramaic Ḥawrān, meaning ‘cave land.’ In geographic and geomorphic terms, its boundaries generally extend from near Damascus and Mount Hermon in the north to the Ajloun mountains of Jordan in the south. The area includes the Golan Heights on the west and is bounded there by the Jordan Rift Valley; it also includes Jabal al-Druze in the east and is bounded there by more arid steppe and desert terrains. The Yarmouk River drains much of the Ḥawrān to the west and is the largest tributary of the Jordan River.</p>

Al-Malik al-Manṣūr relied on him as his physician, and regarded him so highly that in the end he appointed him vizier and entrusted him with state affairs. By then, the [ruler] was so entirely dependent on Najm al-Dīn that he never left al-Malik al-Manṣūr’s side, accompanying him wherever he went. Al-Malik al-Manṣūr died – may God have mercy upon him – in the year 643/1245, after having defeated the Khwārazmians.

                                    may God prolong and increase his blessings and may He necessitate and exceed His munificence toward all his noble-minded predecessors. In his letter, he [the ruler] has made clear the servant’s duty of unquestioning obedience (

                                    ) and the necessity of the State – may God make the State eternal – because of its many merits and virtues. Whatever the master commands, [the servant] must provide, for he knows that opportunity passes like the clouds and that the tasks that are to be done within a limited time, need to be performed correctly. Thus, when there are time constraints, delay is no longer permissible. The master knows the benefit of the order of importance in which things have to be done for all parts of the organisation, and the servant merely acts as an arrow that the master aims, or a sword that he unsheathes. We should – for God’s sake – hurry and hasten, for then the signs of good fortune and victory will become manifest [to us]. But we should beware and be on our guard against delay and neglect, for – may God forbid! – the time in which we can ask God to fulfil our hope and expectations may already have elapsed by then. It is to be hoped that God, through his munificence, supports the slave (
                                    <hi rend="italic">al-mamlūk</hi>
                                    ) [meaning himself] in serving our master the Sultan in a way that will fulfil him with joy and hope, be it by the hand of the master, by word, or by deed, if God, the exalted, wills.

                                            <p>Nawrūz or Nayrūz, the Persian New Year celebrated originally (as today) at the spring equinox but in the Islamic period also at other times. Poets often dedicated congratulatory poems to rulers on this occasion. Al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Muḥammad (d. 658/1260) was the last Ayyubid ruler of Aleppo and Damascus; he surrendered to the Mongols and was executed soon afterwards.</p>

                                Illustration of the foolish misconceptions in the utterances of Muwaffaq ʿAbd al-Laṭīf [al-Baghdādī]. Najm al-Dīn wrote this book when he was just thirteen years old (

This book title is a childish and all too obvious attempt by a member of al-Dakhwār’s circle – as Ragab puts it – to defame ʿAbd al-Laṭīf ibn Yūsuf al-Baghdādī. It is, without any doubt, a reaction to ʿAbd al-Laṭīf’s own mud-slinging, which was directed at the likes of Ibn Sīnā, Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī, Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakariyyā al-Rāzī, Abū l-Ḥajjāj Yūsuf al-Isrāʾīlī and others.

He used to associate with the sons of al-Malik al-Ḥāfiẓ, who respected him and allowed him [considerable] influence in their commands. When al-Malik al-Ḥāfiẓ died, the fortress of Jaʿbar was handed over to al-Malik al-Nāṣir Yūsuf ibn Muḥammad ibn Ghāzī,

Zayn al-Dīn then moved to Aleppo and became an aide to al-Malik al-Nāṣir, in whose estimation he stood high. He married the daughter of the governor of Aleppo, and thus acquired great wealth. When al-Malik al-Nāṣir Yūsuf ibn Muḥammad became the ruler of Damascus, Zayn al-Dīn accompanied him to that city and settled there. He subsequently became one of the most eminent figures of the age, devoting himself to the medical art as well as to military affairs and governmental matters.

                            Eventually, however, Tatar [i.e. Mongol] emissaries from the East came to al-Malik al-Nāṣir demanding the occupation of his lands [i.e. his kingdom] and proposing severe conditions entailing the payment of tribute. Zayn al-Dīn al-Ḥāfiẓī was sent as a messenger to the ruler Hūlākū,

He went back and forth as a messenger many times, encouraging the Mongols to attack the State and terrifying al-Malik al-Nāṣir with accounts of their power and their [vast] empire. He described their great armies and ridiculed the situation of al-Malik al-Nāṣir and his armies. Al-Malik al-Nāṣir became faint-hearted and unwilling to go to battle against them. In due course, Hūlākū’s Mongols appeared before Aleppo and laid siege to it. After approximately a month, they stormed the city, killed all the people [i.e. the men] in it, took the women and children into captivity, plundered the city’s wealth and destroyed the citadel and other [buildings].

                            The Mongols then took possession of Damascus by treaty and installed a representative of their own. Zayn al-Dīn remained there as well. They made him an emir, and assigned a military guard to accompany him at all times, so that he became known as ‘King Zayn al-Dīn’. But when al-Malik al-Muẓaffar Quṭuz, the ruler of Egypt, arrived with the armies of Islam and gave the Mongols a merciless trashing at the famous [battle of] Wādī Kanʿān,

His first career was as a carpenter. He also dressed stone, but he earned [his living] by carpentry, a craft at which he was very skilled. His work was greatly sought after, and most of the doors of the ‘Great Hospital’ that was established by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn Zangī – may God have mercy upon him – are products of his skills and handiwork.

                            the oculist, who was a friend of Abū l-Faḍl al-Muhandis, told me that Abū l-Faḍl’s first acquaintance with science came about because he had in mind to study [the works of] Euclid in order to [further] improve his excellence in the craft of carpentry, gain insight into its particulars, and have freedom of action in the execution of his work. Ibn al-Miṭwāʿ also said that in those days Abū l-Faḍl al-Muhandis used to work at the Khātūn Mosque, which was located below al-Munaybiʿ just west of Damascus. Every morning before arriving at the mosque he had already memorized a part of Euclid’s work. He also managed to solve [some problems] from it on the way to work and after he finished work, until he had unravelled it in its entirety, understood it thoroughly and fully mastered its contents. He then proceeded to read and study the

                            and solve [all the problems] contained therein. In the end, he devoted himself completely to the art of geometry and became an authority in it.

                            I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say: Abū l-Faḍl al-Muhandis also concerned himself with the art of astronomy and drew up astronomical tables (

Abū l-Faḍl became acquainted with him, studied under him and learnt a great deal from him. He also studied the art of medicine under Abū l-Majd Muḥammad ibn Abī l-Ḥakam,

He was also paid a salary for his work as a physician at the great hospital, a post that he held until he died many years later. He was an outstanding physician and a good practitioner, with a pleasant way of dealing [with his patients].</p>

                            Abū l-Faḍl had travelled to Egypt in 572–573/1176–1177. In Alexandria, he had acquired some knowledge of the Prophetic tradition [Hadith] from Rashīd al-Dīn Abū l-Thanāʾ Ḥammād ibn Hibat Allāh ibn Ḥammād ibn al-Fuḍayl al-Ḥarrānī and Abū Ṭāhir Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Silafī al-Iṣfahānī.

He was a deeply religious person, a very distinguished [scholar], who was outstanding in the juridical sciences and pious and godfearing in religious affairs.

                            Saʿd al-Dīn was [placed] in charge of the construction of the al-Ḥanbaliyyah Law College in the wheat market in Damascus. It was the Caliph of Baghdad, al-Mustanṣir bi-Allāh, who had ordered it [the college] built.

                            Saʿd al-Dīn was born in Damascus at the beginning of the month Muḥarram in the year 583 [mid-March 1187]. He served for a time as a physician at the ‘Great Hospital’, founded by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn ibn Zangī, but subsequently entered the service of al-Malik al-Ashraf Abū l-Fatḥ Mūsā ibn Abī Bakr ibn Ayyūb,

That ruler treated him generously, presented him with many gifts, paid him a lavish salary and maintained a close and uninterrupted relationship with him. Saʿd al-Dīn enjoyed [the ruler’s] favour and held an important position in his administration. In the month of Shaʿbān of the year 626 [June 1229], however, al-Malik al-Ashraf went to Damascus as [the city] had been handed over to him by the son of his brother, al-Malik al-Nāṣir Dāwūd ibn al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam.

He was much esteemed, high-minded, with lofty ambitions, and was very precise and determined [in his actions]. Furthermore, his conduct was unimpeachable, and he loved the good in people. He exerted himself tirelessly in the treatment of the sick and was kind and merciful to all.

                            Raḍī al-Dīn and his father settled in Damascus in the year 555/1160, during the reign of the Sultan al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn Maḥmūd ibn Zangī. After they had lived there for some years, Raḍī al-Dīn’s father died and was buried on Mount Qāsiyūn. Raḍī al-Dīn decided to remain in Damascus, where he kept a practice for the treatment of the sick; he wrote many books there. After some time, Raḍī al-Dīn decided to study further under Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ibn al-Naqqāsh,

Muhadhdhab al-Dīn spoke highly of him and preferred him to all [his] other [students], with the result that he was able to enter the service of al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb. This ruler enhanced his position, allotted him a monthly salary of thirty dinars and attached him to the citadel and the hospital. He held that post throughout the reign of Saladin, but refused to accede to Saladin’s request to accompany him when he travelled.

The new ruler ordered [Raḍī al-Dīn] to serve him as his personal physician, but [Raḍī al-Dīn] declined and asked to be allowed to remain in Damascus. At this, al-Malik al-ʿĀdil validated all the emoluments that Raḍī al-Dīn had enjoyed during the reign of Saladin and confirmed that they would remain exactly as they had been. This situation continued until the death of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil.</p>
                        <p>Al-Malik al-ʿĀdil’s successor was his son, al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam ʿĪsā ibn al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, who granted Raḍī al-Dīn a regular stipend of fifteen dinars.

                            Many persons studied the art of medicine under Raḍī al-Dīn. A number of them became outstanding [physicians], and these in turn taught others, who also became prominent men in the field of medicine. Scrutiny of the physicians of Syria reveals that they either studied under al-Raḥbī himself or under one of those who had studied under him. Among those who studied under him at the beginning [of his career] was the shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ibn ʿAlī,

                            The shaykh Raḍī al-Dīn said to me: ‘All those who studied under me and associated with me [later] helped and benefited the people,’ and he named many prominent men who had won renown in the medical profession, including some who were already dead and some who were still alive. He had deemed it appropriate, he said, never to teach medical principles to non-Muslims (

                            ) or to persons who were not worthy of them, for he considered that he was thereby enhancing the profession and upholding its prestige. He told me that in all his life he had taught only two non-Muslims: the physician ʿImrān al-Isrāʾīlī

                            and he had taught them only because they had pestered him and pleaded with him incessantly, until finally he felt he could not turn them away. Both men were exceptionally gifted and became outstanding physicians.
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that some teachers bring good fortune to those who study under them, just as one finds that certain scientific works are more instructive than others. I myself studied medical works by Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakariyyā al-Rāzī and others with Raḍī al-Dīn al-Raḥbī in the year 622–623/1225–1226, especially their practical parts, and I benefitted greatly from them.</p>
                        <p>The shaykh Raḍī al-Dīn was fond of trading and devoted much of his time to commercial activity. In addition, he kept a keen eye on his physical constitution and was concerned about the preservation of his health. Al-Ṣāḥib Jamāl al-Dīn Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Yūsuf ibn Ibrāhīm al-Qifṭī has told me that the physician al-Raḥbī closely followed the basic principles that are necessary for the preservation of health.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – have heard that Raḍī al-Dīn al-Raḥbī employed the very best cooks and instructed them to apply the rules that he himself followed. This was most beneficial to him during daytime, keeping his humours in balance during the [whole] day. When the food was ready, the cooks would inform al-Raḥbī, and he would invite one or more of his friends to join him at dinner. When they arrived, the cooks would ask permission to serve, but he would tell them that they must wait, as [the guests] as yet had no appetite. The cooks would wait until they were called. When al-Raḥbī called to them to bring the food in at once, the cooks would serve the meal. Only then would he eat.</p>
                        <p>One day, one of his friends asked him the reason for this [habit]. ‘Eating with appetite is essential for the preservation of health,’ he replied, ‘for when the members of the body require compensation for what they have used up, they demand it of the stomach, and the stomach in turn summons it from the outside [i.e. the urge to eat again]’. ‘What do you gain by it?’ asked the friend. ‘It is thus that man will attain his natural life span,’ answered al-Raḥbī. ‘But,’ objected the friend ‘you have reached an age which is little short of man’s natural life span, so what is the need for this rigmarole?’ ‘So that during this short period I may stay above the ground,’ said al-Raḥbī, ‘inhaling air and swallowing water, and not under the ground because of a faulty diet.’ He continued to follow this practice until his time came.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="bold">[15.36.1.2]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah continues: I have had a similar experience myself, showing that it is not desirable to eat a meal except with a genuine appetite. Once, I was with Raḍī al-Dīn, studying some of al-Rāzī’s remarks on the order of eating food. Al-Rāzī states that a person should eat twice a day and then once on the following day. ‘Pay no attention to that advice,’ Raḍī al-Dīn said to me. ‘On the contrary, remember to eat whenever you have a real appetite, at all times, no matter whether it is once or twice during the day, day or night; for it is eating with a real appetite that benefits the body, whereas the opposite is harmful’, and he was right.</p>
                        <p>Raḍī al-Dīn always followed his own precept in the matter, regardless of whatever else he might be doing. On Saturdays, he would always go to the garden to rest and refrain from work. Thursday was the only day on which he went to the bath. He made it a rule to do these things in a regular order. On Fridays, he used to go to see all the prominent people and the notables. He steadfastly refused to climb a ladder – when he needed to visit a patient, the patient had to be in a place where it was not necessary to climb a ladder – or even to go near one, describing the ladder as “the saw [which cuts off] life”. He once made a particularly astonishing remark to my father. ‘Since the time I bought this place, in which I have lived for more than twenty-five years,’ he said, ‘I do not remember ever having gone up to the room at the top [of the house], except for the one time when I inspected the house [before] buying it. I have never been up there again from that day to this’.</p>

                            always ate poultry, but hardly ever ate mutton. He complained to Raḍī al-Dīn al-Raḥbī about his pale complexion, for which physicians had [previously] prescribed many different syrups and other [medicaments]. Raḍī al-Dīn went out, returning shortly with a piece of chicken breast and a piece of red mutton, ‘You are accustomed to eat the meat of fowl,’ he said to the vizier, ‘but the blood produced by fowls does not have such a reddish hue as the blood of sheep, and you can see that the colour of sheep meat is very different from the colour of this piece of chicken meat. You should give up eating fowl and stick to eating mutton instead. That will make you better and there will be no need for [further] treatment’. The vizier accepted Raḍī al-Dīn’s advice, and ate what the physician had recommended. It was not long before his colour returned and the balance of his humours [i.e. his equilibrium] was restored.

                        <p>Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah continues: This is a very convincing account, and I would recommend it to everyone who wishes to be cured and seriously wants to ensure the preservation of his health. The vizier was a robust, well-proportioned man who possessed a strong physique and had a good digestion, but the members of his body were afflicted by the weak blood that he [obtained from eating] fowl’s meat. He needed coarser and stronger blood. When he went over to eating mutton, he began to produce stronger blood that supplied the needs of his bodily members, so that his humours became balanced and his colour returned to normal.</p>

He left two sons, the eldest named Sharaf al-Dīn Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī and the younger, Jamāl al-Dīn ʿUthmān. One of his relatives, who had been at his bedside during his final illness, told me that at the time of his death Raḍī al-Dīn felt the pulse of his right hand with his left hand, with a pensive and reflective air as he did so. He then clapped his hands, for he knew that his strength had failed. He straightened the cowl [

From an early age he gave his full attention to collecting and studying books, while his soul was constantly devoted to a search for virtue. Sharaf al-Dīn pursued the medical art very assiduously, carefully studying its details and general principles. He also composed works of his own on medicine and wrote annotations on others.</p>

                            Sharaf al-Dīn was a solitary individual who was constantly reading and studying in order to gain insight into the literary work of ancient authors and to benefit from the books of the sages. He was a righteous and high-aspiring man who did not like to frequent rulers and state officials. He worked for some time at the ‘Great Hospital’ founded by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn ibn Zangī. When our shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ibn ʿAlī

The latter’s circle wanted to rehabilitate the dominance of two authors, Ibn Sīnā and al-Rāzī, and placed more emphasis on practical writings derived from their own experience. The works of the polymath ʿAbd al-Laṭīf al-Baghdādī (see chapter 15.40), however, clearly stood in opposition to those of al-Dakhwār’s circle. Al-Baghdādī had severe doubts about al-Rāzī’s writings, loathed Ibn Sīnā’s medical and philosophical works, and paid much more attention to the theoretical side of medicine. The authors of al-Dakhwār’s circle therefore seemed to have neglected al-Baghdādī’s oeuvre and never referred to it. Be that as it may, it still remains a remarkable fact that al-Dakhwār himself appointed Sharaf al-Dīn al-Raḥbī, who was a student of al-Baghdādī, as the first professor of the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Madrasah al-Dakhwāriyyah</hi>
                                    in Damascus. Unlike the other circle members, Sharaf al-Dīn al-Raḥbī never composed treatises on his own practice and experiences, and he may, therefore, have occupied a more neutral position within the circle. One may even deduce from all of this that Sharaf al-Dīn al-Raḥbī remained out of the circle, perhaps because of his special position, and out of loyalty to his shaykh.

                            because Sharaf al-Dīn had proven to be an erudite and intelligent person. He held that post for a time and then died – may God have mercy upon him – in Damascus. He was buried on Mount Qāsiyūn. He died – may God have mercy upon him – of pleurisy on the night preceding Friday the eleventh of Muḥarram in the year 667 [20 September 1268].

                            The physician Badr al-Dīn, the son of the judge of Baalbek, and Shams al-Dīn al-Kutubī, known as al-Khawātīmī, have informed me that months before he fell ill and died, Sharaf al-Dīn had told visitors and students that he would die soon at the conjunction of the two planets.

                                    was used indiscriminately for both a fixed star and a planet. Given that stars do not move with respect to one another, and therefore cannot meet in conjunction, a conjunction of two planets must be intended by the phrase

The two planets are unspecified, but it is likely that it was either a conjunction of Mars with Saturn, with which ominous events were always associated, or the sun with the moon, for the conjunction of the latter two results in an eclipse – a result more easily observed as well as predicted than that of a Mars-Saturn conjunction. According to the astrology website astropro.com, a Mars-Saturn conjunction took place on 25 September 1268, five days after the date given above, while according to the

The precision with which the death date was recorded is unknown.

He studied the art of medicine under the guidance of his father and others, and mastered it completely, becoming an excellent therapist and competent in prescribing medicaments.

                            He was very fond of trading and spent most of his life doing business. He owned and ran a basket and mat shop in Damascus, for he disliked earning a living through the art of medicine. Once the great extent of his knowledge had become widely known and his erudition had come to light, rulers and notables begged for his services and sought his medical advice. The prince al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr ibn Ayyūb and others asked him to serve them and associate with them, but he refused. For many years he visited the ‘Great Hospital’ founded by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn ibn Zangī, treating the patients in there in anticipation of a reward in the hereafter [i.e. as a pious deed]. Eventually, however, it was decided that he should receive some form of payment for his services, and he did so until he died – may God have mercy upon him – on Tuesday the ninth of the month Shaʿbān in the year 612 [3 December 1215].

His family hailed originally from Mosul, but he was born in Baghdad. He was renowned for his knowledge of the [various] sciences and his personal virtues. A prolific writer, he was a master of literary style as well as Arabic grammar and lexicography.

He had lived in Damascus for a time, and while there had devoted much attention to the art of medicine and acquired a great reputation for his knowledge of it. Students and physicians used to frequent his lectures and study under him.

                        <p>The shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Laṭīf himself was a highly industrious person. He never let a moment pass without devoting himself to the study and composition of books and the art of writing. The works that I have seen in his own handwriting are very many, since he used to make numerous copies of his own works and copied several books of earlier authors as well. He was a friend of my grandfather’s; a strong friendship had grown up between them while they were both residing in Egypt. My father and my grandfather used to study the literary arts under him. My uncle also studied the works of Aristotle with him, for the shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn was very interested in them and wished to understand their meaning. From Egypt he went to Damascus and stayed there for some time, and many people benefited from his teaching [there]. I saw him when he was living in Damascus on his final visit to that city. He was an old man of fragile physique, of medium height, a good speaker, expressing himself very well; still, his written word was more impressive than his speech. At times – may God have mercy upon him – he would go too far in his talk: he had a high opinion of himself and would find many shortcomings in the intellectuals of his time and in many of former times also. He frequently disparaged the learned men of Persia and their works, especially the distinguished Master Ibn Sīnā and people like him.</p>

I could not understand one bit of his continuous and considerable jabbering, even though his students apparently admired him for it. In the end, he said: ‘I loathe teaching young boys and instead pass them on to my disciple al-Wajīh al-Wāsiṭī to study under his guidance.

Finally, I would read my lesson and al-Wajīh would favour me with his own comments. Then we would leave the mosque, and on the way home he would help me to memorize what I had learnt. When we reached his house, he would take out the books that he was studying himself. I would memorize them with his help and help him memorize them as well. Thereafter he would go to see shaykh Kamāl al-Dīn, to whom he would recite his lesson and who would then comment on the lesson, while I listened. I became so highly trained that I began to outstrip him in powers of memory and understanding. I used to spend most of the night in memorizing and repeating [the lessons]. We continued thus for a while, with me as a disciple of both my master and my master’s master. My memory increased and improved continually, my insight became deeper and more acute and my mind became sharper and more reliable.

He had the air of a religious man and looked like a traveller; those who saw him before getting to know him were struck by his appearance. He was known as Ibn Tātalī and claimed to be among the descendants of ‘the children of the veiled’ (

The name Tātalī – if that is the correct reading – is totally obscure and obviously not Arabic but presumably Berber. The only Tātalī we could find, is a place somewhere in Italy, mentioned in al-Idrīsī (

                                    Ibn Tātalī had a peculiar way of teaching. Those who came to see him considered him immensely learned, but in fact he merely possessed strange and radical views. He had carefully studied works on alchemy and talismans and similar subjects, and had also studied all the works of Jābir and Ibn Waḥshiyyah.

                                    I transcribed and studied many books by Jābir ibn Ḥayyān al-Ṣūfī and Ibn Waḥshiyyah, and I began to practise the false art and to make the frivolous and idle experiments of error. The most potent of the influences that led me astray was that of Ibn Sīnā, by his book on the art (i.e., alchemy), which he supposed completed his philosophy. However, it adds nothing to philosophy, but rather derogates from it.

His love of alchemy and its practice had so drowned his intellect and his time that he attached no importance to anything else but that art. Large numbers of students gathered around me, and various positions were offered to me; I chose the second-storey law college of Ibn Muhājir and the

I had in mind to go and look for him, but good fortune intervened. I asked Ibn Yūnus for some of his [i.e., Suhrawardī’s] works, for he also had a strong belief in the man’s qualities. I read the

In the midst of his discourse, he would insert detached letters, by which he made people like himself believe that they were to be considered divine mysteries.

                                    When I entered Damascus, I found there a great number of notables from Baghdad and elsewhere, who had been brought together through Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn’s generous patronage. Among these were Jamāl al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Laṭīf, the son of shaykh Abū l-Najīb, a group from the Grand Vizier’s family, Ibn Ṭalḥah, the secretary, members of the households of Ibn Jahīr, Ibn al-ʿAṭṭār, the vizier who was later executed,

He was a brilliant, intelligent and wealthy shaykh, who enjoyed the favour of the Sultan, but who was quite taken with himself and offensive to his company. We had many debates and God – exalted be He – permitted me to surpass him in many of the issues that we discussed. Later I neglected to attend him, and my neglect offended him, even more than people were offended by him.

                                    a notable personality who enjoyed great prestige and respect, was opposed to him. Later, Ibn Tātalī made a serious mistake and aided his foes against himself, for he began to speak about alchemy and philosophy, and disparaging remarks about him soon became more frequent. I met with him, and he began to question me concerning various pursuits, which I regarded as contemptible and trivial, though he, on the contrary, attributed great importance to them, and wrote down all that I said about them. I saw through him and found that he was not the man I had imagined him to be, with the result that I came to have a poor opinion of him and his methods. When I spoke about the sciences with him, I found that he had only a superficial knowledge of them. One day I said to him:

Afterwards, Ibn Tātalī went to see Saladin on the outskirts of Acre

                                            He undoubtedly went to see Sultan Saladin in his army camp that was set up during the siege of Acre (585–587/1189–1191). ʿAbd al-Laṭīf al-Baghdādī has left us a rather brief but very lively description of such a camp, see al-Maqrīzī,

It was said of him that he was able to do things that even Mūsā ibn ʿImrān [i.e., the prophet Moses] was unable to do, that he could produce minted gold whenever he wished, of any quantity he wished, and in any coinage that he wished, and that he could turn the waters of the Nile into a tent, under which he and his companions would be able to sit; yet he was in a sorry state.

                                <p>One day I was in the mosque with a number of people gathered around me, when an old man dressed in shabby clothes entered. He was sharp-featured, with a pleasing appearance. The crowd stood in awe of him and showed him reverence. I finished what I had to say, and when the meeting was over, the imam of the mosque came to me and said, ‘Do you know this old man? He is Abū l-Qāsim al-Shāriʿī’. I embraced him and cried, ‘It is you I seek!’ I brought him to my house, and after our meal we entered into conversation. I found him to be all that souls can desire and eyes delight in. His conduct was that of a man of wisdom and intelligence, his bearing likewise. He contented himself with the barest necessities of life, not involving himself with anything that would distract him from moral excellence. Following our initial encounter, he frequently sought my company, and I found that he was well versed in the works of the ancient philosophers and of Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī. I did not have much confidence in any of those [authors], thinking as I did that the whole of philosophy had been encompassed by Ibn Sīnā and was embodied in his books. When we engaged in discussion, I would surpass him in strength of disputation and refinement of language, but he would surpass me in the force of his argumentation and the clarity of his methods. I did not yield to his arguments, nor did I give up my passionate and stubborn [resistance] to his allusions. But then he presented me with work after work by Abū Naṣr [al-Fārābī], Alexander [of Aphrodisias] and Themistius in an effort to tame my aversion and to soften my headstrong disposition, until I inclined towards his side, putting one foot forward and the other back.</p>

                                    News arrived that Saladin had concluded a truce with the Franks and had returned to Jerusalem, so it was necessary for me to go and see him there. I took with me as many of the books of the ancient philosophers as I could carry and set out for Jerusalem. There I saw a formidable king, who filled all eyes with respect and all hearts with love, who was approachable, tolerant and generous. The members of his entourage tried to imitate him, competing for recognition. As the word of God, exalted be He, says: «

                                    The first night I entered his presence, I found myself at a meeting attended by men of learning, discussing various sciences. Saladin listened attentively and took an active part in the conversation, taking up the subject of the manner of building walls and digging trenches. He had a good understanding of this matter and came up with all kinds of original ideas. He was concerned about the construction of the walls of Jerusalem and about the digging of its trenches. He himself took part in the work of carrying stones on his shoulders. His example was followed by the whole population, poor and rich, strong and weak alike, even the secretary al-ʿImād and al-Qāḍī al-Fāḍil followed his example. For this purpose, he would ride out on horseback before sunrise. At the time of midday prayer he would return home, have a meal and rest. He would mount his horse again at the time of the afternoon prayer, and would return home in the evening, then spend most of the night planning what he would do the next day. Saladin assigned to me in writing thirty dinars a month [to be paid by] the administrative office of the mosque.

The more deeply I studied the books of the ancient philosophers, the more my desire for them increased, whereas [my desire] for the books of Ibn Sīnā waned. I began to realise the vanity of alchemy and to know the truth of the matter about its foundation, its founders, and their lies and motivations. I was thus delivered from two great, ruinous errors. My thanks to God were redoubled on that account, for many people have been led to perdition through the books of Ibn Sīnā and alchemy.</p>

                                    Saladin subsequently returned to Damascus, but left the city again to bid farewell to the pilgrims [leaving for Mecca]. Upon his return, he became feverish and was bled by someone without any skill.

I have never seen a ruler whose death so saddened the people; for he was loved by the pious and the profligate alike, by Muslims and infidels.

                                    At midday, those who wished to study medicine and other subjects would come to me. Then at the end of the day, I would return to the al-Azhar mosque to teach other students. At night I used to study for myself. In this manner I continued until the death of al-Malik al-ʿAzīz. He was a generous, courageous young man, modest and unable to say no. In spite of his youthfulness and tender age, he was wholly abstinent from worldly possessions and sexual pleasures.

He used to frequent the al-Aqṣā mosque, where he had pupils who studied many different sciences under his guidance, and he composed many books. In the year 604/1207 he set out for Damascus, where he took his abode in the al-ʿAzīziyyah law college, devoting himself to teaching and study. Many pupils came to study with him and learn various sciences under his guidance. He distinguished himself in the art of medicine, composing many books in that domain, and acquiring a great reputation in it, whereas formerly his fame had rested on his mastery of the science of grammar. He stayed in Damascus for some time, and many people derived great benefit from him.</p>

Muwaffaq al-Dīn devoted much of his time to teaching the art of medicine and other sciences, but also frequented the mosque, where he would listen to lectures and teach the Arabic language. He was always engaged in writing and composing [works]. When he was living in Aleppo it was my intention to meet with him, but it did not happen. I received a steady stream of books and letters from him, including some of his works in his own handwriting.

May God elucidate the paths of right guidance to him and illuminate the ways of knowledge for him in the life hereafter, and confirm his authority through the [revelation of] the true meaning of his words. May his happiness continue to exist unendingly, his mastery ascend to lofty heights and may his writings remain in all lands the model for the learned and the main source for all men of letters and philosophy. The servant renews his homage, offers his most courteous salutations and his most affectionate thanks and compliments. He makes known to you the pain from which he suffers in his endeavour to witness the lights of the illuminating sun, the joy that is provoked by the exciting vision of your noble and illustrious presence and the intensification of his anxiety and the graveness of his insomnia on hearing of the nearness of his visit.

                        <p>Among the letters of the shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Laṭīf is one that he sent to my father. At the beginning of the letter he said of me, ‘The son of the son [i.e. the grandson] is dearer than the son. This Muwaffaq al-Dīn [i.e., Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah] is the son of my son and no one is dearer to me than he. His excellence has been clear to me ever since his early youth’. He then continues to speak appreciatively of me and praises me. He also says in this letter, ‘If I could go to him in order to enable him to study under my guidance, I should do it’, indicating that he had decided to remove to Damascus and settle there.</p>

                            Then it came to his mind to go on pilgrimage first, making his way via Baghdad, and offering some of his works to the caliph al-Mustanṣir bi-Allāh.

                            After reaching Baghdad he fell ill and died – may God have mercy upon him – on Sunday, the twelfth of Muḥarram 629 [9 November 1231]. He was buried next to his father in the al-Wardiyyah cemetery. This happened after an absence of forty-five years from the city of Baghdad. God, exalted be He, sent him back and decreed his fate there.

Prepare yourself for the good things that you will do in the morning, and ask God for help in this.</item>

                            <item>I urge you not to study the sciences from books [only], however confident you are in the strength of your [own] understanding, but go and find yourself teachers for every science you seek to acquire. If a teacher should prove deficient, take from him what he has until you find one more perfectly acquainted with the subject than he is. You must honour and respect him. If it is possible for you to help him with your worldly goods, do so; otherwise serve him with your words and praise. When you read a book, strive to learn it by heart and understand its meaning. Imagine that the book is missing and that you are able to do without it, for its loss would not grieve you. When you are devoting yourself to the study of a book and you try to understand it, beware of working on another book at the same time; rather, spend the time that you wished to spend on the second book on the first. Beware of studying two sciences simultaneously, but devote yourself to a single science for one or two years or for how long God wishes. When you have attained your aim in this, move on to another science. Do not think that when you have acquired knowledge of one subject, you have done all that is necessary: you need to keep it up, so that it progresses and does not stagnate. The way to keep it up is by memorizing it and reflecting upon it. The beginner occupies himself by being mindful of it and by studying and discussing it with his fellow-students. The work of the sage lies in teaching and writing books. When you undertake to teach a science or engage in discussion on it, do not combine it with any of the other sciences, for every science stands alone and is independent of other sciences. When you bring in a [second] science to assist you with the first, you are unable to treat its divisions exhaustively; like someone who uses one language for another when he either cannot express himself in it or is partially ignorant of it.</item>

He apparently believed that the most excellent scholars earned the right to be granted this type of remuneration, in order not to have to follow the ‘basic’ occupations. In this sense, it is likely that he followed Aristotle’s opinion, expressed at the beginning of the

The particular usage of the phrase ‘self-abasement before the great ones of the earth and hanging about their gates’ by ʿAbd al-Laṭīf may be a sneer in the direction of the Jewish philosopher and physician Maimonides, who, according to ʿAbd al-Laṭīf, was ‘dominated by the love of temporal dignities and a courtier of those in high station’. The learned (

                                            ) often felt that some occupations degraded them through something like pollution: ‘The learned man should keep away from the basest custom, such as the art of cupping, dyeing, money changing, and gold-smithing’ (see Ibn Jamāʿah,

                            <item>All activities aimed at gaining worldly goods require that one should occupy oneself exclusively with them, that one should possess the necessary skills to acquire them, and that one is able to devote [all of] one’s time to them. He who dedicates himself to science is not able of doing this. Therefore, he bides his time waiting for the world to come to him for no reason at all, expecting the world to seek him out without his seeking out the world in a similar manner, but this is wrong of him and exceeds the proper bounds. Nevertheless, when a man masters science and made a reputation for himself in it, he is in demand from all sides and positions are offered to him. Then the world comes to him in a submissive way and he conquers it with his honour perfectly intact and his dignity and his faith well kept. Know that science leaves a trace and a scent, which proclaim its owner, a light and a gleam that shine upon him and mark him, as in the case of a dealer in musk: his place cannot be concealed, nor can his merchandise be ignored; just as in the case of one who walks with a torch in a pitch-black night. Furthermore, the learned man is loved wherever he is and whatever his situation is. He only meets those who are well disposed toward him, who desire to be near him, who seek out his company and find ease in his proximity.</item>

                            <item>Know too that the sciences sink in the ground and then gush out at a certain time, as in the case of plants or springs of water: they pass from one people to another and from one region to another.</item>

                        <p>I have copied a few more examples of his aphorisms from works in his own handwriting, including the following:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>Let your speech be in general according to these qualities: it should be brief, intelligible, referring to an important matter or at least an appropriate one, and contain well-executed enigmas that are more or less ambiguous. Do not let it be careless like the speech of the masses, but raise its level somewhat, without estranging your hearers too much.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>Beware of idle talk and senseless speeches, but also beware of silence when it is necessary to speak and your turn to speak has come, to bring out the truth, or to become beloved or to exhort to excellence. Beware of laughing while you speak, and being too talkative, and from cutting your speech short, but let your speech be coherent and take time for a breathing space. Deliver it with dignity, so that it may give the impression that there is more behind it than in it and that it is the product of previous maturing and past reflection.</item>

                        <p>Another example is the following:</p>
                        <list>

                            <item>Beware of vulgarity in your discourse and harshness in debate, for that destroys the beauty of the speech, deprives it of its usefulness, robs it of its charm, causes grudges and blots out friendships. The speaker then becomes a boring person, whose silence is more desirable to the listeners than his speech, and the people will choose to point out his faults, will denigrate him and take away his dignity.</item>

He enjoyed the favour of rulers, who depended on him for medical therapy and treatment: they showered large sums of money upon him and treated him with generosity beyond description. He acquired more books on medicine and other subjects than almost anyone else.

                        <p>ʿImrān al-Isrāʾīlī never attached himself to the personal service of any ruler or accompanied him on his travels. Yet, whenever a ruler fell ill, or someone for whom it was difficult to call on him, he would not hesitate to provide the finest medical treatment and would take good care of the patient until the cure was completed. Al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr ibn Ayyūb desired to engage him for his own personal service, but ʿImrān refused him, as he did other rulers.</p>

                            his host suffered from a serious indisposition of his temperament. The physician ʿImrān was summoned to come over from Damascus, and stayed with al-Malik al-Nāṣir for some time, providing him with medical treatment, until the prince recovered. The physician was then given a robe of honour and presented with a large sum of money. al-Malik al-Nāṣir also offered him a monthly salary of 1500 dirhams if he would enter his service, and even agreed to advance him the sum of 27,000 dirhams, the amount of his salary for eighteen months. However, ʿImrān declined the offer.

His prosperity continued under al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam, who also assigned him an ample salary and a special grant. ʿImrān regularly visited the ‘Great Hospital’ [

The cooperation of these two doctors was very fruitful and was highly advantageous for the treatment of the patients. At that time I was training under their guidance in the practical application of medicine, and thus I was able to witness the physician ʿImrān’s amazing treatment [of patients] and his accurate diagnosis of diseases. One day, for example, a hemiplegic was brought to the hospital, and the physicians insisted that he should be administered certain boiled decoctions and other [medicaments] that they used to prescribe. When ʿImrān looked at him, he put him on a diet for that day, and afterwards ordered him bled. After having been bled, he was treating him until he was completely restored to health. I have also observed many times that ʿImrān prescribed vegetarian dishes [

                            was one of the foremost persons of his time in the domain of knowledge, understanding and critical examination of Galen’s works. Thanks to his constant efforts in the art of medicine, his ardent desire and perseverance in reading and studying the works of Galen, his excellent innate character and high intelligence, the entire range of Galen’s works and the teachings in them were always present in his mind. Whenever speaking about the art of medicine, its various divisions, the diversity of its topics, and the many minor issues concerning it, he always quoted Galen. Whenever he was asked a question on some medical problem or a certain passage, whether difficult or otherwise, he would simply reply by saying ‘Galen says’ and quoting some of Galen’s utterances. For this he was greatly admired. Sometimes, when quoting some of Galen’s sayings, he even indicated such and such page of a certain chapter of Galen’s works, referring to the copy in his possession, for he had studied that copy so many times that he had become wholly accustomed to it.

                            I have witnessed the following with regard to the above. Early in my studies of the art of medicine, I read some of the texts of Hippocrates with him, which I had to learn by heart and comment upon. At the time, we were staying in al-Muʿaẓẓam’s military encampment, where my father too was employed in the service of al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam

                                    Al-Malik al-Muʿaẓzam ʿĪsā ibn al-ʿĀdil I Muḥammad or Aḥmad Sayf al-Dīn, Sharaf al-Dīn (r. 615–624/1218–1227). See Bosworth,

                             – may God have mercy upon him. I observed that Muwaffaq al-Dīn could explain everything so excellently and was able to penetrate deeply into the subject matter in such clear, concise and complete language as no one else would have been able or would have dared to do. He would then present a summary of what he had said, giving the gist of it, so that there remained no passage in the Hippocratic writings that he had not explained in the best way. Next, he mentioned what Galen had said in his commentary with regard to the chapter in question, in an uninterrupted sequence from beginning to end. When I consulted Galen’s commentary on this section, I found that he had given a full account of the complete Galenic text on this subject. He had even quoted many of the very words used by Galen, without adding or leaving out a single one. He was the only man of his time who was capable of doing this.

                            While Muwaffaq al-Dīn was living in Damascus, he met the shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ibn ʿAlī

                            quite frequently in the salon assigned to the physicians at the Sultan’s palace, and the two would discuss various medical matters. The shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn spoke more eloquently and was more skilled and a better scholar, whereas the physician Yaʿqūb had more presence. He spoke more precisely and, moreover, quoted the [ancient] authors and their works more extensively; for he was in the position of an interpreter who could call to mind that what Galen had said in all his books on the art of medicine.

                        <p>
                            Yaʿqūb’s treatments were impressively excellent and successful. That was because he would first acquire knowledge about the disease in a most thorough manner and then would start the treatment according to the rules laid down by Galen, yet he would act independently and also used contemporary insights. He took great pains with his examination of the symptoms: whenever he examined a patient, he would ask endless questions about all of the patient’s symptoms and complaints, so that he would never overlook any symptom that allowed him to obtain more information pointing to the diagnosis of the disease. Consequently, his treatment was always excellent. Al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam praised him for this quality. Describing his character, he said: ‘If doctor Yaʿqūb’s only merit were taking the utmost care to diagnose illnesses in order to treat them correctly, there’d be no doubts about him on that score’. Yaʿqūb also possessed a thorough mastery of the Greek language, which he rendered expertly into Arabic. He had in his possession some of Galen’s works that were written in Greek, such as

He was also well-versed in astrology and the observation of the stars: he knew of fates that had been foretold and had come to pass, and amazing warnings. The physician Yaʿqūb related to me many things about his knowledge of philosophy, his good character and his intelligence. In Jerusalem, the physician Yaʿqūb also met shaykh Abū Manṣūr al-Naṣrānī, the physician, under whom he studied.

                        <p>The physician Yaʿqūb was a very clever, astute and level-headed person. While he was in the service of al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam ʿĪsā ibn Abī Bakr ibn Ayyūb, who had great faith in him as a friend, the ruler relied not only on his medical judgement, but also on his judgement in other matters, which invariably turned out to al-Muʿaẓẓam’s advantage, with a favourable outcome. Al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam wanted to appoint Yaʿqūb to a post in the administration of his realm, but the physician refused, preferring to devote himself exclusively to the art of medicine.</p>

Al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam visited him regularly, honoured him greatly, paid him a generous salary and did him many favours. One day he asked him, ‘O physician, why don’t you cure that ailment in your legs?’ Yaʿqūb replied, ‘O master, once wood has become worm-eaten, there is no remedy for it’. Yaʿqūb remained in his service until al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam died,

He then recited the following verses:

Al-Malik al-Nāṣir bestowed many favours upon Yaʿqūb, gave him money and attire, ordered that he should continue to receive all he had been granted by al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam, and excused him for attendance at the palace. This situation continued until Yaʿqūb died in Damascus on the Christian Easter, which fell in the month of Rabīʿ

He was an outstanding physician and an eminent scholar, distinguished in the theory and practice of the art of medicine and a master in the particulars and universals of medicine. He studied the art of medicine under his father and others. In al-Karak, he also studied many of the natural sciences under the learned authority Shams al-Dīn al-Khusrawshāhī.

                            Rashīd al-Dīn ibn al-Ṣūrī’s full name was Abū Manṣūr ibn Abī l-Faḍl ʿAlī al-Ṣūrī. He had a comprehensive knowledge of all aspects of medicine and keen insight into the obvious and hidden merits of that art. His knowledge of simple drugs, their nature, different names and characteristics, and the precise determination of their properties and effects, was incomparable. He was born in the year 573/1177 in the city of Tyre [i.e. Ṣūr]. He grew up there, but later on moved away to study the art of medicine under shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz

                            and under their tutelage became a distinguished exponent of the art of medicine. Rashīd al-Dīn resided in Jerusalem for several years, practising medicine in the local hospital. He came to be on friendly terms with the shaykh Abū l-ʿAbbās al-Jayyānī,

                                    Is this perhaps the physician Ḥakīm al-Zamān Abū l-Faḍl ʿAbd al-Munʿim ibn ʿUmar ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Ḥassān al-Ghassānī al-Andalusī al-Jilyānī as mentioned in Ch. 15.11 above? Or rather the Andalusian herbalist Abū l-ʿAbbās al-Nabātī, who arrived in Syria (al-Shaʾm) around circa 613/1216 and referred many times to the area around Jerusalem. According to our source,

                                    , Ibn al-Ṣūrī spent two years in Jerusalem, approximately from 611/1214 to 613/1216. It is quite remarkable that the cognomen al-Jayyānī obviously refers to the city of Jaen, which is removed only 200 kilometers from Seville. See Amar &amp; Serri, ‘Ibn al-Suri’, 125–126.

                            who was an outstanding authority on simple drugs, well-versed in other sciences and a pious and charitable person. Rashīd al-Dīn ibn al-Ṣūrī benefitted greatly from his friendship with this shaykh, from whom he learned much. He also became familiar with many of the specific properties of simple drugs, to such an extent that he outshone many scholars in that domain, and others who had aspired to mastery of it. Rashīd al-Dīn combined all this with the highest of virtues, unprecedented zeal, an unparalleled intelligence and extraordinary courage.

                        <p>In the year 612/1215, Rashīd al-Dīn entered the service of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr ibn Ayyūb as a physician. When al-Malik al-ʿĀdil left Jerusalem for Egypt, Rashīd al-Dīn accompanied him and remained in his service until al-Malik al-ʿĀdil – may God have mercy upon him – died. Thereafter, he entered the service of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil’s son, al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam ʿĪsā ibn Abī Bakr, who gave him a powerful position [in his realm], making him a prominent personality in his day and age. Together with his patron, he witnessed a number of battles with the Franks, when they fell upon the port of Damietta [i.e. Dimyāṭ]. Rashīd al-Dīn remained in al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam’s service until that ruler – may God have mercy upon him – died. He was succeeded by his son, al-Malik al-Nāṣir Dāwūd ibn al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam, who continued to pay Rashīd al-Dīn his salary and, in consideration of his previous service, entrusted him with the office of chief physician. Rashīd al-Dīn remained in his service until al-Malik al-Nāṣir moved to al-Karak. The physician stayed behind in Damascus, where he established a scholarly salon that was frequented by many persons wishing to study the medical art. He also accurately formulated the ingredients of the great theriac, in which he combined such drugs as he deemed proper, with the result that its benefits became manifest and its effects powerful. He had previously prepared a great quantity of it in the days of al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam. Rashīd al-Dīn ibn al-Ṣūrī – may God have mercy upon him – died in Damascus on Sunday the first of the month of Rajab of the year 639 [5 January 1242].</p>

                            for full protection and the ultimate fulfilment of his wishes. May God crush those who are envious of him and confound his enemies, and make his excellent qualities linger on when he is gone. May his virtue emanate towards his peers and may all tongues agree in thanking and praising him. May health be preserved through his wise supervision, and may diseases vanish through his excellent care and treatment. The servant performs his service with joy, regretting that he has been unable to be constantly present. May the noble and precious things for which [the servant] ardently longs meet the greatest expectations, and may instruction on medical matters combine theory and practice. The servant has made that a basis on which to rely and a code to which to refer. He will always remember them and will not harm those for which he is responsible.
                        </p>
                        <p>Nothing can be compared to the beneficence of the master but the devout prayer of the servant and the praise elicited by his good qualities, which diffuse a fragrant perfume. Why should I not praise and propagate the good qualities of a man who I find to possess only moral excellence! I have found ease only because of him. God hears the devout prayers of his servant and the master gives all good things out of his perfect generosity, if God, exalted be He, so wills.</p>

                        <p>Rashīd al-Dīn al-Ṣūrī is the author of the following books:</p>

                                On simple drugs (
                                <hi rend="italic">K. al-adwiyah al-mufradah</hi>
                                ). He began to compose it during the reign of al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam, to whom he dedicated it. The book gives a full account of simple drugs, and also provides insight into simples of which the author had acquired knowledge, and which had not been mentioned by his predecessors. Rashīd al-Dīn ibn al-Ṣūrī would go to places in which plants grew, such as Mount Lebanon and other spots in which particular plants were found, taking along with him a painter who had at his disposal all kinds of dyes and brushes. Rashīd al-Dīn would observe and examine the plants, and then he would show them to the painter, who would look at their colour, measure their leaves, branches and roots, and then paint them, doing his utmost to make them as realistic as possible. Rashīd al-Dīn had an instructive method for these illustrations: first he would show them to the painter at the time of sprouting and tenderness, and would have him paint them at that stage. Then, he would show them to him when they were fully grown and in full bloom, and the painter would depict them at that specific stage. Finally, he would show him the plants when they were withered and dried up, and the painter would sketch them at that stage. In this way, the reader of the book could see the plants as he would encounter them in the field, and this would enable him to obtain more perfect information and clearer notions.

                            Abū l-Thanāʾ Maḥmūd ibn ʿUmar ibn Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Shujāʿ al-Shaybānī al-Ḥānawī, known as Ibn Raqīqah, was a man endowed with a noble soul and perfect virtues. He gathered together the medical teachings of the ancient authors that had become scattered, stood out above all his peers, and surpassed his fellow physicians and healers. Moreover, he possessed an outstanding character, flawless diction and a wonderful [gift] for composing poems of high stylistic quality, of which many have become proverbs and maxims. As for verse in

                            ) from the eyes of many persons, who, thanks to his skill, were able to see again. The instrument that he used for that purpose was hollow and curved, so that during the operation, the fluid could be more efficiently extracted, with the result that the treatment was more effective.

                                    Though today we know that cataracts are due to an opaque lens, in medieval literature it was said that an opaque fluid was interposed between the lens and the pupil of the eye. When treating cataracts, the technique commonly used was an ancient one, known to classical antiquity and possibly originating in India. This ancient technique of ‘couching’ pushed the lens to one side rather than removing it. This present passage is important evidence that at least some physicians attempted to remove the cataract by suction through a hollow needle. If such a procedure was in fact actually successfully carried out, it could only have worked on a soft juvenile cataract. See Pormann &amp; Savage-Smith,

He had a learned brother, named Muʿīn al-Dīn, who was the most outstanding scholar of his time in the Arabic language, which was his particular domain, but he also composed many poems. Sadīd al-Dīn ibn Raqīqah also studied under masters in the domain of Hadith.

Send us a rain that drenches, lush, life-giving, bursting forth in buckets, abundant, long-lasting, copiously, timely and not tarrying, salubrious and not harmful, which makes plants grow, fills the udders, and revives the earth after it has died!’ And, by God! No sooner had the Messenger of God (God bless and keep him!) lower his hand to his chest than the heavens opened. The Prophet’s closest followers began to shout, ‘Messenger of God! A flood! We’ll drown!’ The Prophet turned his eyes to the sky and laughed, so that his molar teeth could be seen.

The shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn treated him for a number of days, but then had to leave and accordingly advised Nūr al-Dīn ibn Artuq to consult Sadīd al-Dīn ibn Raqīqah. He did do, and the physician cured him within a short time. Grateful for his complete recovery, Nūr al-Dīn ibn Artuq awarded Sadīd al-Dīn a stipend and an allowance in recognition of his medical services. Sadīd al-Dīn told me himself that he was then not yet twenty years old.

                            of the year 632 [23 February 1235], Sadīd al-Dīn ibn Raqīqah arrived at the court of Sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf in Damascus, where he was kindly received and greatly honoured. Al-Malik al-Ashraf ordered him to attend the Sultan’s household in the citadel and also to treat the sick at the ‘Great Hospital’, which had been founded by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn ibn Zankī. For his services, al-Malik al-Ashraf allotted him a stipend and an allowance.

                            At that time, I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – was also receiving payments for treating the patients at that hospital. Sadīd al-Dīn and I became great friends. What I was able to observe of his perfect virtues, noble origins, rich knowledge, and excellent skills in the domain of diseases and their treatment is beyond all description. He lived in Damascus, devoting himself to the art of medicine, until he died – may God have mercy upon him – in the year 635/1238. I, for my part, had already moved to Ṣarkhad

                            ibn Ṣadaqah al-Sāmirī was one of the greatest medical authorities and belonged to the most distinguished and exemplary practitioners of the art of medicine, having been constantly engaged in study and research. He was very knowledgeable, extremely intelligent, and well-versed in philosophy and its riddles: he taught the art of medicine, but also composed mediocre poetry,
                            <hi rend="italic">dūbayt</hi>
                            poems for the most part, in which he often included philosophical witticisms. Al-Sāmirī is also the author of a number of philosophical and medical works.
                        </p>
                        <p>Ṣadaqah al-Sāmirī spent many years in the service of al-Malik al-Ashraf Mūsā, the son of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr ibn Ayyūb, with whom he stayed in the East until his death. Al-Malik al-Ashraf, who relied on him in medical matters, held him in the highest esteem and honoured him greatly, allotting him large sums of money and constantly bestowing favours upon him. Ṣadaqah died in the city of Ḥarrān sometime after 620/1223. He left behind an enormous fortune, but no children.</p>
                        <p>The following are some of the sayings of Ṣadaqah al-Sāmirī, which I copied from his own handwriting.</p>
                        <p>‘Fasting consists in denying food to one’s body and keeping the senses from error and the limbs from sin; it is refraining from everything that distracts from the remembrance of God’.</p>
                        <p>Another of them: ‘Know that all pious deeds are visible except fasting, which can be seen by God alone; for it is an inner act of sheer perseverance. Fasting has three degrees: the general fast, which consists in restraining the stomach and liberating oneself from the gratification of desire; the special fast, which consists in keeping the ear, eye, tongue and all the limbs from sin; and the extraordinary fast, which consists in the heart’s abstinence from base concerns and mundane thoughts and its concentration on God alone, exalted be He’.</p>
                        <p>
                            A third: ‘The body’s secretions that do not undergo change and are not transient,
                            <note n="123" type="footnote">
                                <p>
                                    Enduring?
                                    <hi rend="italic">Laysa lahu maqarr</hi>
                                    means ‘has no fixed abode; does not stay in one place’; but none of these excretions stays for long in one place. Or perhaps guts and bladder count as ‘fixed abodes’.
                                </p>
                            </note>
                            such as tears, sweat, spittle and mucus, are pure, whereas the more long-lasting and changeable secretions, such as urine and excrement, are impure’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A fourth: ‘Know that the [word] vizier (
                            <hi rend="italic">wazīr</hi>
                            ) derives its name from [the expression] ‘to carry a burden’ (
                            <hi rend="italic">ḥamala l-wizr</hi>
                            ) for the one whom he is serving; but bearing this burden is only possible if the vizier’s physiognomy and his natural disposition are sound. As regards his physiognomy, he should cut a fine figure and be of a pleasing appearance, with well-proportioned limbs and excellent senses. As regards his natural disposition, he should have superior insight and far-reaching aims, be highly intelligent and possess an outstanding intuitive knowledge of human nature. He should also be broad-minded, possess all the manly virtues, and have knowledge of matters of all kinds. Given those qualities, he is of the greatest value for the state, for he will keep the ruler from ruin, ensure that he does not stoop to baseness, and dive for opportunities for him [i.e., pave the way for him]; his function is that of an instrument that can serve to fulfil every desire, a wall that keeps the plague out of the city, or a bird of prey that catches food for its master. But not everyone who is qualified for such a task can serve every ruler, if he is not known for his devotion to the one he serves, his love for the one who claims his exclusive service, and his preference for the one who has raised his position’.
                        </p>
                        <p>A fifth: ‘The patience of the chaste is graceful’.</p>

He was a man of the greatest merits and a very pleasant person, having been benevolent, noble-hearted and sensitive. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Yūsuf studied the art of medicine under the physician Ibrāhīm al-Sāmirī, who was known as ‘the sun of the physicians’ and served al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Yūsuf (Saladin). Muhadhdhab al-Dīn also studied under the tutelage of the shaykh Ismāʿīl ibn Abū l-Waqqār,

                            Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Yūsuf was distinguished in the art of medicine and renowned for his sound medical treatment and therapy, as may be seen from the following [anecdote]. Sitt al-Shām, the sister of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr ibn Ayyūb, was afflicted with a dysentery of the liver (

                            ) that caused her to throw up quantities of blood every day. Her physicians were treating her with the accepted remedies against this disease, such as potions and the like. When Muhadhdhab al-Dīn arrived and felt her pulse, he said to the assembly, ‘O Gentlemen, as long as she has some strength left, give her camphor (
                            <hi rend="italic">kāfūr</hi>

It was not long before she stopped [throwing up] blood, and her liver became less inflamed. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn administered this potion to her again on the second day and she improved further. Thereafter, he applied a supportive regimen until she had made a complete recovery.

                            the vizier of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, told me the following story. ‘Once,’ he said, ‘our master suffered from pain in his back, due to a chill. The physicians who came to attend him, treated him by correcting his diet and boiling a little castoreum (
                            <hi rend="italic">jund bīdastar</hi>

                            ). “In place of all these things,” said Muhadhdhab al-Dīn, “it would be beneficial to try something that has a pleasant smell,” a suggestion that delighted al-Ṣāḥib Ibn Shukr. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Yūsuf then ordered a perfume made of musk and ambergris (

                            Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Yūsuf served ʿIzz al-Dīn Farrukhshāh ibn Shāhanshāh ibn Ayyūb as his physician. When ʿIzz al-Dīn Farrukhshāh died – may God have mercy upon him – in Jumādā

During that ruler’s lifetime, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Yūsuf enjoyed his good graces and received much money and many favours from him. The ruler consulted him on his affairs and relied on him with respect to his enterprises. The shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was a man of good character, who possessed sound intelligence and vast knowledge. The ruler thought his views sound and his intentions honest, and finally made him a vizier. In that post, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Yūsuf’s power increased and his importance grew, until he came to be in charge of the whole government and of all the affairs of state, and his commands and prohibitions could not be disobeyed. This caused the shaykh Shihāb al-Dīn Fityān

                        <p>These two lines of poetry were recited to me by Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Shihāb al-Dīn Fityān, who said, ‘My father recited these verses, composed by himself, to me.’</p>
                        <p>I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say: ‘The shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn continued to enjoy his lofty status. However, there was a growing chorus of complaint about his family and his Samaritan relatives. A group of them had come up to him in Baalbek from Damascus, and as a man of high-standing whom none dared to resist, the vizier had given them all posts. But they only caused injustice, waste and corruption, and when al-Malik al-Amjad realized that money had been wasted and corruption had increased, and other rulers criticized him for handing over his government to the Samaritans, he finally had Muhadhdhab al-Dīn al-Sāmirī arrested, along with all the Samaritans who were in his service, and extracted large sums of money from them. The vizier remained in prison until there was nothing left of his fortune. He was then released and moved to Damascus. I saw him there in his house. When he arrived from Baalbek, and my father and I went over to call on him, I found him to be a fine old man, eloquent in speech and refined in opinion. He died a little later, on a Thursday, at the beginning of Ṣafar of the year 624 [21 January 1227], in Damascus’.</p>

                            This Amīn al-Dawlah was a man of unsurpassable intelligence, whose knowledge was unparalleled among his peers. He was charitable and high-minded, performed many acts of kindness, and continually bestowed favours upon everyone. He acquired exhaustive knowledge of the art of medicine, to the uttermost limits of that domain. He was well aware of the outcomes of medicine, and had a perfect knowledge of its principles and branches, to the point that he had few peers, for even the learned and the accomplished were not able to attain to his superior status. He first served al-Malik al-Amjad Majd al-Dīn Bahrām Shāh, the son of ʿIzz al-Dīn Farrukh Shāh ibn Ayyūb,

                            and the notables of the realm became aware of the sums of money that Amīn al-Dawlah had amassed, they decided to arrest him and confiscate his property. They prepared a trap for him by sending for him and showing respect for his importance by standing up when he came in. When he was seated in their midst, they said to him, ‘If you wish to stay in Damascus, stay as you are, and if you wish to go to your master in Baalbek, do so’. ‘By God,’ he replied, ‘of course I will go to my master and stay with him’. He then left, collected his possessions, valuables, cash and everything that he owned, including the furniture and carpets from his houses, loaded the lot on a number of mules and set out for Baalbek. When he was just outside Damascus, he was arrested; everything that he carried with him was seized and placed under guard, and he was detained. This took place on Friday, the second of the month of Rajab, of the year 643 [23 November 1245]. He was then escorted to Egypt and thrown into prison in the fortress of Cairo, together with other associates of al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ Ismāʿīl.

The Egyptian forces were repulsed at first, but rallied and finally routed the Syrians. Al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ Ismāʿīl and many of the other princes and emirs were captured and imprisoned in Egypt. Some of them were later released, but al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ Ismāʿīl was never heard of again. It was said that he had been strangled with a bowstring.

                            that the princes of Syria had defeated the Egyptian troops. When the vizier Amīn al-Dawlah, in the fortress of Cairo, heard this, he said to the commander of the fortress, ‘Let us go free in the fortress, until the [Syrian] princes arrive, and then you will see how well we shall treat you’. The commander of the fortress wished to do that himself and set them free. In that section of the prison there were three of al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ Ismāʿīl’s entourage: his vizier Amīn al-Dawlah, his majordomo, Nāṣir al-Dīn ibn Yaghmūr, and a Kurdish emir called Sayf al-Dīn. ‘Friends,’ said the Kurd, ‘do not hurry, but stay where you are; if the situation is as we hope, our master will certainly set us free, restore us to our former positions, treat us generously, and rescue us. But if the situation is not as we hope, we shall do better to stay in our places and not go rushing out; that will be safer for us’. But the vizier and Nāṣir al-Dīn ibn Yaghmūr did not agree and went out to various places all over the fortress, commanding and forbidding. When the outcome of the battle had been contrary to what they had hoped, ʿIzz al-Dīn al-Turkumānī ascended the fortress and ordered Nāṣir al-Dīn ibn Yaghmūr killed and the vizier hanged.

                            who was known as Ibn ʿUlaymah. He was in the service of al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb. “When the Ṣāḥib Amīn al-Dawlah was imprisoned by my master,” he said, “he sent for an Egyptian astrologer, who possessed extensive and acute knowledge of astrology and whose horoscopes were almost invariably accurate. Amīn al-Dawlah asked the astrologer about his situation and whether he would be released from prison. When the astrologer received the message, he examined the altitude of the sun at that particular moment, studied the degree of the ascendant, the twelve houses and the positions of the planets [relative to the twelve houses], wrote it all down, cast a horoscope and made his prediction in conformity with it”. “Amīn al-Dawlah will be released from prison,” he said, “and will leave it cheerful and happy. He will be favoured by fortune and remain in a high position in Egypt, and his orders and commands will be obeyed by all the people”. When this response reached Amīn al-Dawlah, he received it joyfully. Upon being informed of the arrival of the [Syrian] princes and their victory, he went out quite sure that he would remain a vizier in Egypt. Thus, the astrologer’s prediction of his release from prison, his happiness, the obedience to all his orders and commands, and his ending up in a high position came true that day. But Amīn al-Dawlah did not suspect what would happen to him later on, for God, mighty and glorious, was already preparing that which had been predestined for him and was written in the Book’.

                            When Amīn al-Dawlah – may God have mercy upon him – was occupying the office of vizier in Damascus in the days of al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ Ismāʿīl, he was a close friend of my father’s. One day he said to him, ‘Sadīd al-Dīn, I have heard that your son has composed a book on the classes of physicians that is unprecedented. All the physicians in my service praise him greatly for his highly valuable book. I have in my library more than twenty thousand volumes, but none in that particular domain. I would like you to send him a letter and ask him to have a copy of that book made for me.’ At that time I was in Ṣarkhad, at the court of its ruler, the emir ʿIzz al-Dīn Aybak al-Muʿaẓẓamī, and subject to his orders. Upon receiving my father’s letter, I went to Damascus, taking along with me the rough drafts of my book. There, I called upon the illustrious copyist Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad al-Ḥusaynī, who did a lot of copying work for us: his handwriting was excellent, and his mastery of the Arabic language was admirable. I gave him space at our home, where he copied the book in a fairly short time, putting it into four sections, in quarter Baghdādī format.

                                    Paper made in Baghdad was said to be of the best quality. It was a heavy yet pliable paper, smooth-surfaced and symmetrical; the standard ‘full’ Baghdadi sheet of paper was one cubit in width and one-and-one-half cubits in length (ca. 1099 mm × 733 mm). A sheet would then be folded a number of times to produce the desired size of codex. See Bosch, Carswell &amp; Petherbridge,

He sent the judge back with a large sum of money and honorary robes for me, along with many expressions of gratitude. ‘It is my desire that you notify me of every new book you write,’ he said.

His intelligence and knowledge was unparalleled among his peers. He was charitable and high-minded, performed many acts of kindness, and continually bestowed favours upon everyone.</p>
                            <p>He acquired exhaustive knowledge of the art of medicine, to the uttermost limits of that domain. He was well aware of the outcomes of medicine and had a perfect knowledge of its principles and branches, to the point that he had few peers, for even the learned and the accomplished were not able to attain to his superior status.</p>

                            <p>Our teacher, the great and eminent authority, the learned and excellent Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ibn ʿAlī ibn Ḥāmid, who was also known as al-Dakhwār, was – may God have mercy upon him – the outstanding man of his period, unrivalled during his lifetime, the most learned scholar of his generation. He held a leading position in the art of medicine and knowledge of its universals and particulars. There was no one who could match him in diligence or keep up with him in respect of knowledge. He drove himself unsparingly, exhausting his mind in order to attain knowledge, until he surpassed all his contemporaries in the art of medicine. To the day of his death, he enjoyed the good graces of rulers and was presented by them with more wealth and honour than any physician had ever enjoyed before.</p>

                                Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was born and raised in Damascus. His father, ʿAlī ibn Ḥāmid, was a renowned oculist. His brother, Ḥāmid ibn ʿAlī, was also an oculist. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was initially an oculist as well, but at the same time he worked as a copyist. His calligraphy was of a high order of skill, and he transcribed many books, of which I have seen at least a hundred or more volumes, dealing with medicine and other [sciences]. He studied the Arabic language with shaykh Tāj al-Dīn al-Kindī Abū l-Yumn

                                the vizier of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr ibn Ayyūb, provided him with a stipend, enabling him to work as the vizier’s physician and at the same time to study and improve his grasp of medical theory and practice. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn remained in the service of the Ṣāḥib Ṣafī al-Dīn ibn Shukr and visited him frequently. His employer was well aware of his mastery of the art of medicine and his knowledge, virtue and merits. In the month of Shawwāl of the year 604 [April–May 1207], al-Malik al-ʿĀdil said to the Ṣāḥib Ibn Shukr: ‘We want another physician besides Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz to take care of the troops and to visit them when they are ill. The physician ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz is not able to deal with this.’ ‘O master,’ Ibn Shukr replied obediently, ‘I know of an excellent physician, named al-Muhadhdhab al-Dakhwār, who would be suitable to enter your service’. ‘Engage him,’ said al-Malik al-ʿĀdil. When Muhadhdhab al-Dīn reported for duty, the Ṣāḥib said to him, ‘I have praised you before the Sultan, and you will be paid thirty Nāṣirī dinars monthly for your services’. ‘O vizier,’ Muhadhdhab al-Dīn replied, ‘the physician Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz earns a hundred dinars monthly, and as much again in allowances. I know my worth, and I will not serve without a proper stipend,’ and he left the vizier, refusing the post. His friends, however, criticized his refusal of an opportunity of entering the ruler’s service, because his salary at the hospital was rather low.

                            <p>
                                Approximately a month after this discussion, as chance would have it, al-Muwaffaq ʿAbd al-Azīz was stricken with severe colic (
                                <hi rend="italic">qawlanj</hi>
                                ). It was treated, but grew worse, and in the end he died. When the news of his death reached al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, he said to his vizier, ‘Once, in front of us, you praised a doctor called al-Muhadhdhab. Appoint him in place of al-Muwaffaq ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz’. So, Muhadhdhab got his salary after all, and he remained in the service of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil from then on. He rose in his esteem and his status was enhanced, until he became the ruler’s companion, intimate friend and chief counselor.

                            <p>At the beginning of his service, al-Malik al-ʿĀdil also put the physician to the test in some unusual cases. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn’s answers confirmed the ruler’s good opinion of him and reliance upon him.</p>
                            <p>
                                It was then also that al-Malik al-ʿĀdil became ill. He was attended by the best doctors, including Muhadhdhab al-Dīn, who advised bloodletting, but the attending physicians did not approve.

                                ‘By God,’ said Muhadhdhab al-Dīn, ‘If we do not let blood from him, he will bleed of his own accord’. The [other] doctors still did not agree with him, but very soon thereafter the Sultan experienced heavy nosebleeds. When he recovered, he knew that Muhadhdhab al-Dīn outshone all the other doctors.

                                A similar story has it that one day, when Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was standing at the palace gate with some of the court physicians, a servant came out with a phial of urine from one of the slave girls, saying that he was consulting the physicians because the girl was complaining of pain. When the other physicians had examined the [contents of the] phial, they prescribed something that they had prepared. But when Muhadhdhab al-Dīn examined the phial, he said, ‘It is not the pain of which she complains that has caused the colour of the contents of this phial’, suspecting that the source of the the colour was the henna [

                                ] with which the girl had been dyed. The servant informed him that he was correct in his judgement, marvelled at him and reported back to al-Malik al-ʿĀdil; this increased the ruler’s confidence in him.

                                        Al-Malik al-ʿĀdil was once very angry and full of rancour at the chief judge of Damascus, Muḥyī l-Dīn ibn Zakī al-Dīn, because of some issue, I forget what it was. He had him imprisoned in the citadel, and he ruled that the judge was to pay him the sum of ten thousand Egyptian dinars. Al-Malik al-ʿĀdil pressed him hard: the judge was to remain in prison until he settled the full amount. He managed to pay some of it, but was unable to raise the balance. Al-Malik al-ʿĀdil took the matter very seriously. ‘He must pay the rest of the money, for otherwise I shall have him tortured’. The judge was at his wit’s end: he sold off all his assets, his household furniture, and even the books that he possessed. Then he appealed to the Sultan, using the good offices of many of the emirs, leading personalities and notables, such as al-Shumays, the chief steward,

But the Sultan refused. The judge now became so worried about it that he hardly ate or slept and was on the verge of killing himself. Then, his old friend, the physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn, paid him a visit. The judge complained to him about his troubles and asked him for help, if there was anything he could do. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn thought it over for a while and then said, ‘I shall think of something for you and hope that it will be of use, if God, the exalted, wills,’ and took his leave.

She was of Turkish origin, an intelligent, pious and devout woman, and was very kind and generous. The physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn came to see her, accompanied by the chief eunuch (

He requested her to mediate, in the hope that she could persuade the Sultan to show mercy toward the judge and be lenient toward him by remitting a part of the debt or by letting him pay in instalments. The chief eunuch supported him, but the concubine said:

I cannot do this, because he will say to me, ‘What makes you speak about the judge, and how is it that you know of him?’ If he were, for instance, a doctor who visits us from time to time, or a merchant who sells us cloth, it would be possible for me to speak to the Sultan and intervene; but as for this one, it would be impossible for me to speak about this person.</p>

                                    <p>When the physician heard this, he said, ‘My lady! You have only one son, for whom you wish happiness and a long life. You can now obtain all these excellent things for him from God, because you are in a good position to do so, and you do not have to intervene with the Sultan at all’. ‘How so?’ she asked. ‘When the Sultan and you are sleeping together,’ said the physician, ‘say that you saw in a dream that the judge was being treated unjustly’. He told her what to say, and she replied, ‘It can be done.’ When she was well again and al-Malik al-ʿĀdil was sleeping next to her, as the night was ending, she lay awake pretending to be frightened, clutching her heart, trembling and crying. The Sultan, who loved her dearly, woke up and said, ‘What is the matter?’ but she did not tell him what the matter was. He then ordered some apple juice to be brought, had her drink some, sprinkled her face with rose water and said, ‘Why don’t you want to tell me what has happened to you and what is on your mind?’ ‘O husband,’ she replied, ‘I have had a terrible dream, which almost frightened me to death. I dreamt that the day of final judgement had come and saw a large crowd of people. In one place, where there was a great fire burning, people were saying, “this is for al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, because he treated the judge unjustly”. Did you ever wrong a judge?’ she asked.</p>
                                    <p>He did not doubt her words, felt uneasy about it, then rose up, called his servants and said, ‘Go to the judge and delight his heart, give him my regards and apologies for what has happened to him, and inform him that all he has paid will be returned to him. I, for my part, will ask nothing of him’. So they went to him. The judge was delighted with their news, blessed the Sultan and announced that he accepted his apology. When morning came, the Sultan ordered [that he be given] a full robe of honour and a mule. He restored him to his office and ordered that all the money he had paid should be reimbursed from the treasury, and that all the books and other possessions he had sold were to be redeemed from the purchasers for the same amount as they had paid. Thus, relief was brought to the judge after hardship, by minimum effort and the subtlest of measures.</p>

Muhadhdhab al-Dīn treated the governor most attentively until he became well again. Again, the physician received gold, robes of honour and many splendid gifts: twelve thousand gold dinars, fourteen mules carrying golden necklaces, many robes of honour [made] of satin [

I was then with my father, who was [also] in the service of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil. My father was entrusted with matters involving oculists in view of the fact that it was he who decided who was qualified to treat eye diseases.

                                and my father. The physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn, for his part, was provided with an ample salary and instructed to reside in Damascus and return to the ‘Great Hospital’ that had been founded by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn ibn Zangī, where he was to treat patients.

                            <p>During his time in Damascus, the shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn began to teach the art of medicine, and many of the best physicians joined him, while others studied under him. I, too, stayed in Damascus to learn from his teaching, but I had first worked under him at the military camp where he and my father were serving the great Sultan. I would frequent his classes as one of a group [of students], and I began to study the works of Galen.</p>
                            <p>
                                Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was well-versed in everything that that author and other authors had written, and admired the books of Galen very much. Whenever some of the words of Galen were mentioned concerning diseases and their treatment, or the fundamentals of medicine, he would say, ‘That is medicine!’ He was eloquent, could convey a meaning admirably, and was a good researcher. I accompanied him also during my period of training at the hospital while he was treating the patients, and thus I gained practice in the art of medicine. At that same time, the physician ʿImrān [al-Isrāʾīlī] also worked with him at the hospital.

                                ʿImrān was one of the most eminent and senior-ranking physicians in matters of therapy and the management of medical treatment. Their co-operation and the talks they conducted about diseases, therapy and the descriptions of diseases were doubly beneficial for us.

                                The physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn became one of the most able representatives of the art of medicine. He was a prodigy in the domain of therapy and the treatment of patients, and would prescribe medicaments that could cure in almost no time. In [all of] this he surpassed his contemporaries. Hence the impression was given that it was magic. Once, I saw him perform a feat of that kind. A man had come to him with a burning fever and extremely dilated pupils. After estimating the patient’s strength, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ordered that a quantity of camphor seeds should be pounded in a drinking cup. Writing this down in a recipe (
                                <hi rend="italic">dustūr</hi>
                                ), he told the man to drink it and not to take anything else. When the morning came, we found that the patient’s fever had broken and that his pupils were no longer dilated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It also happened, whilst in the ward for bilious patients, he treated someone suffering from the disease called mania (
                                <hi rend="italic">māniyā</hi>
                                ), which is rabies (
                                <hi rend="italic">al-junūn al-sabuʿī</hi>
                                ), by prescribing that an ample amount of opium (
                                <hi rend="italic">afyūn</hi>
                                ) should be added to his barley water at the time when he was given it to drink. The man became better and his condition improved at once.
                            </p>
                            <p>One day, I saw Muhadhdhab al-Dīn in the fever ward, where we had halted to see a patient. The doctors felt the patient’s pulse and said, ‘It is weak. Let’s give him some chicken broth so that he can regain his strength’. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn examined him and said, ‘His speech and vision do not explain the weakness’. He then felt the pulse of the man’s left hand and palpated the other hand. ‘Feel the pulse of his right hand,’ he said, ‘and we observed that it was strong’. ‘Now examine the pulse of his left hand,’ said Muhadhdhab al-Dīn, ‘and then observe how in the part close to his radius [i.e. radial bone] the artery has been divided in two sections. The one that you felt remains as it is, whereas the other section emerges from the highest part of the ulna [i.e. elbow bone] and extends in the direction of the fingers.’ We found this [conclusion] to be correct. ‘A pulse like this,’ he said, ‘is rarely seen, and is not understood by many doctors. They will assume that the pulse is weak, but it is the shape of this section, in which the vein is divided in two halves, that causes them to make that specific error’.</p>
                            <p>
                                During this period the shaykh Raḍī al-Dīn al-Raḥbī also stayed at the hospital. He was a senior-ranking physician who was widely known and respected. He used to sit on a bench and wrote notes [i.e. recipes] for all the patients who arrived at the hospital and consulted him. They depended on these notes, because it enabled them to take home syrups and medicines from the hospital that he had prescribed. After the physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn and the physician ʿImrān had finished their treatment of the patients, they would remain at the hospital, and I would stay with them. I used to sit with the shaykh Raḍī al-Dīn al-Raḥbī, and saw with my own eyes how he collected information regarding diseases. I became a witness of everything that he put down in writing and prescribed for the patients. I studied many of the diseases and their treatments together with him. From the time of the hospital’s construction and [even] during later periods, these three shaykhs have remained the most eminent physicians who ever met there. They worked there for some time.

When he had finished, it was the turn of the physicians and students who came to his house in droves. Every one of them would read his lesson, which he then would discuss with them according to each person’s capability of understanding. In the case of topics that required a fuller analysis, or contained some obscurities that needed to be elucidated, he would discuss them with the more gifted pupils. He never taught anyone unless there was a copy of that book at his disposal for the student to read. He examined and collated it, and if there was an error in the copy that the pupil was reading, he would have it corrected. The copies that the shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn’s pupils perused were known for their faultlessness, and most of them were in his own handwriting. His medical and philological books, such as the

                                were constantly within reach. When he encountered a philological term in his studies that needed to be clarified and commented upon, he would look it up in these books. When the pupils had finished their lessons, he would spend some time alone and take some supper. The remainder of the day was dedicated to memorizing, learning and studying; he stayed up most of the night studying. During that same period, the shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn also associated with shaykh Sayf al-Dīn ʿAlī ibn Abī ʿAlī al-Āmidī.

                                They were old friends and studied the philosophical sciences together. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn memorized some parts of Sayf al-Dīn’s works and obtained most of them so that he could study them, such as the

                            <p>Later in his life, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn also turned his attention to astrology and astronomy, which he studied with Abū l-Faḍl al-Isrāʾīlī, the astrologer. He acquired instruments made of brass, which he needed for that discipline. Apart from those, he did not possess much, apart from a great many books. I heard him say that he was in possession of sixteen extraordinary treatises on the astrolabe by a group of authors.</p>
                            <p>During that time he was summoned by al-Malik al-Ashraf Abū l-Fatḥ Mūsā, the son of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, who resided in the east. The physician set out in that direction in the month of Dhū l-Qaʿdah of the year 622 [November 1225]. He told me later that he had undertaken the journey only after having decided to purchase mules, tents and utensils that were absolutely necessary for the journey, to the amount of twenty thousand dirhams. Upon his arrival, al-Malik al-Ashraf honoured him greatly and bestowed many favours upon him. He allotted him an estate in the east which yielded him approximately fifteen hundred dinars every year.</p>

                                Muhadhdhab al-Dīn remained in the service of al-Malik al-Ashraf for some time, but then he suffered from a heaviness and slackness of the tongue and was unable to speak fluently. He moved to Damascus when al-Malik al-Ashraf gained control over that city in the year 626/1229 and appointed Muhadhdhab al-Dīn as his chief physician. He held that post for quite a long time, and the ruler created a

                                As time went on, his speech problem grew worse; when he tried to speak it was very hard to understand him. His pupils would discuss issues in front of him. Whenever the meaning [of something] was difficult, he would respond with the shortest word that pointed to the essence of the meaning. At times it was difficult for him to speak at all, and then he would write on a slate, and the pupils would read what he had written. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn tried hard to cure himself and cleansed his body with several types of purgatives. He also took many medicaments and hot electuaries, swallowing them constantly. Then he contracted a fever that became so intense that his strength failed, with the result that many diseases followed in succession. When one’s term has been reached, effort is in vain.

He left no offspring. In the year 622/1225 (before he had left Damascus to enter the service of al-Malik al-Ashraf) he dedicated his house in Damascus, near the old goldsmith’s quarter east of the great market,

                            <p>I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – continue: This Ibn Kharūf, who is mentioned by Shihāb al-Dīn Fityān, was a poet from North Africa who frequently ridiculed the physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn. Ibn Kharūf met his end in Aleppo, where he had gone to praise its ruler, al-Malik al-Ẓāhir Ghāzī, the son of Saladin. After reciting his eulogy, he took a step back. There was a well there, into which he fell and died.</p>

They both grew up and studied in that city. My grandfather – may God have mercy upon him – was a high-minded person, who had a great liking for men of virtue and studied the sciences himself. He was known as Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah. He had moved to Egypt when al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb conquered it, and was in his service and that of his sons. Among my grandfather’s acquaintances and friends in Damascus had been Jamāl al-Dīn ibn Abī l-Ḥawāfir,

By the time he met them again in Egypt, my father and my paternal uncle were in the prime of life. My grandfather had in mind to teach them both the art of medicine, because he was well aware of its noble rank and the people’s great need for physicians, and held that one who was committed to its truths would be honoured and favoured in this world and be given the highest rank in the world to come. Accordingly, he set my father and my uncle to study under the guidance of these two shaykhs, giving them the opportunity to benefit [from their knowledge].

                                My grandfather set my father to study the science of ophthalmology and learn its practice under Abū l-Ḥajjāj Yūsuf. Abū l-Ḥajjāj was then serving as an oculist in the hospital in Cairo – that is, not the later hospital belonging to the fort, but the older one that was situated, at that time, near the flea markets of lower Cairo. My grandfather lived nearby, so that my father was able to attend the teaching of Abū l-Ḥajjāj Yūsuf frequently, until he became an expert in the domain of oculism. He also studied under the guidance of other notable physicians who were living in Egypt during that time, such as the chief physician Mūsā al-Qurṭubī,

This Taqī was well-versed in many different sciences, had a fine way of teaching from books, and his authority as a teacher, unattained by anybody else, was famous. After my uncle – may God have mercy upon him – had learned to memorize the Qur’an and had become acquainted with mathematics, all under Taqī’s guidance, he began to study the art of medicine thoroughly under Jamāl al-Dīn ibn Abī l-Ḥawāfir, who was then the chief physician in Egypt, under the rule of al-Malik al-ʿAzīz ʿUthmān, the son of al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāh al-Dīn. My uncle studied sections of Galen’s ‘Sixteen Books’ with Jamāl al-Dīn, and had memorized the first books in a very short time. Accordingly, he engaged in discussions with the physicians, saw the patients in the hospital, and learned about the various maladies and the appropriate prescriptions (there was a group of very notable physicians at the hospital). At the same time my uncle studied the science of ophthalmology and learned its practice with the judge Nafīs al-Dīn al-Zubayr,

Al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam listened to what he had to say, showed him great honour, treated him generously and asked him to enter his service, but my uncle was unable to accept because of the Sultan’s military operations.

When they arrived, he welcomed them, treated them most generously and allotted them an ample salary, allowances and high rank. He gave my uncle such a good position that he hardly left the ruler’s side. When al-Malik al-Amjad discovered my uncle’s excellent knowledge of arithmetic, he asked him to instruct him in this field. My uncle obeyed and taught him everything there was to learn of that science, and even compiled, for his use, a textbook on arithmetic comprising four treatises.

The best physicians and oculists came treated him, but were unable to cure him; they decided unanimously that he must inevitably become blind, as no treatment had had any effect whatever. When my father saw this man and examined his eyes, he said, ‘I will treat this man’s eyes and he will see with both of them, if God, exalted be He, so wills’. In response to his treatment, both Sulayṭah’s eyes steadily improved, until his recovery was complete and he had regained his health. He became his former self once more, and was able to ride a horse again, so that the people were astonished and regarded the treatment as an unrivalled miracle. As a result, al-Malik al-ʿĀdil gained a good impression of my father and paid him the utmost honour by presenting him with special robes and other items.</p>
                            <p>Even before this achievement, my father had been accustomed to frequent the palace of the Sultan in the citadel of Damascus, treating those who were afflicted with serious eye diseases and curing them in short order. This also came to the attention of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil. ‘Such a man should go with me wherever my travels lead me!’ he exclaimed, and asked him to enter his service. My father asked to be excused and permitted to remain in Damascus, but his request was not granted. The Sultan offered him a salary and allowances, and my father finally enrolled in his service on the 15th Dhū l-Ḥijjah of the year 609 [9 May 1213]. The Sultan and all his sons relied on him for medical treatment, and they treated him with great generosity, bestowing many favours upon him. He remained in their service until al-Malik al-ʿĀdil – may God have mercy upon him – died.</p>
                            <p>My father was then invited to continue in his post by the late ruler’s son and successor in Damascus, al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam, who also had confidence in him and trusted his judgment, perhaps even more [than his father had done]. My father served al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam from the beginning of Ṣafar of the year 616 [18 April 1219] until the Sultan – may God have mercy upon him – died. Then al-Malik al-Nāṣir Dāwūd, the son of al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam, in his turn invited him to remain in his service, promising him all the benefits that he had enjoyed in the days of his father. My father stayed with him until it happened that al-Malik al-Nāṣir had to leave for al-Karak, while my father stayed behind in Damascus. He continued to frequent the Sultan’s palace in the citadel, serving the royal household, that is to say, all the descendants of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil who governed Damascus, and others as well. All of them revered him highly and relied on his medical treatment, and he was paid a salary and allowances and enjoyed many favours.</p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, my father used to frequent the Great Hospital of Nūr al-Dīn, where he also received a salary and allowances. People flocked to him from all sides, when they found out about his rapid cures. Diseases that required the use of surgery he treated by that means, and those that could be treated with drugs he treated by that means, thereby sparing those patients the ordeal of surgery. This method was praised by Galen in his book

It was treated first by drug therapy, rubbing it with gum ammoniac dissolved in strong vinegar or a salve of rose oil, wax and turpentine, or similar medicament. If that failed, the eyelid was to be everted and the lid incised with a lancet having at the opposite end a small scoop with which the chalazion could then be scraped out. If the resulting opening was large, the edges of the incision were drawn together with a suture.

Today the condition is known to be due to an opaque lens, but in medieval literature it was said that a membrane was interposed between the lens and pupil. The technique commonly used to treat it is in English called couching; it was an ancient technique, known to classical antiquity and possibly originating in India, in which the opaque lens (or ‘crystalline humour’) was not removed but rather pushed to one side.

                                on the way to Mount Qāsiyūn. My uncle, for his part, was serving at the court of al-Malik al-Amjad when al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam came to Baalbek to reinforce al-Malik al-Amjad and help him [fight] his adversaries, the Hospitallers. When the two princes met with their respective suites, my uncle would join them. At that time, there was no one who had a better knowledge of music and the art of playing the lute than he, nor was there anyone with a better voice, so that the listeners found their souls touched with deep emotion (the same has been said of Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī). Al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam was greatly impressed by my uncle and engaged him in his service, beginning on 1 Jumādā

                                of the year 610 [18 September 1213]. The Sultan granted him a salary and allowances, visited him frequently, and treated him most generously. He spent most of his time in the company of his physician and relied upon him in all matters relating to the art of medicine. The same can be said of al-Malik al-Kāmil Muḥammad and al-Malik al-Ashraf, both of whom depended upon him. Whenever one of them came to visit his brother, al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam, my uncle would constantly be at their side, and he obtained many presents from both of them.

                            <p>I know of one occasion, when al-Malik al-Kāmil came to visit his brother, al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam; they had a meeting in a friendly atmosphere, and my uncle sat with them. That same night, al-Malik al-Kāmil gave [my uncle] a complete robe of honour and five hundred Egyptian dinars. When al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam was in Damascus, he appointed my uncle as military secretary, and insisted on his acceptance of the post. The only thing my uncle could do was to obey this order. He sat in the administrative office and received the common soldiers and the officers. He spent all his days in his secretarial post, but then realized that most of his time was spent in correspondence and calculations, with no spare time at all and no leisure left for himself to devote to the rational sciences and other matters. He appealed to the Sultan to be released from his job, asking a group of his intimate friends to put in a good word for him, until the Sultan acceded to his request.</p>

The Franks advanced, and the old Sultan al-Malik al-ʿĀdil and his son al-Muʿaẓẓam fell into disagreement as to the route of their retreat. My uncle set out towards Damascus in the company of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, while al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam went in the direction of Nablus. My uncle subsequently left Damascus in the company of al-Malik al-Nāṣir Dāwūd, the son of al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam, but when they arrived at ʿAjlūn,

                                al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam ordered his son to go back and they all returned to Damascus. My uncle then fell ill; his illness continued for the rest of that year, and he found that travelling was harmful to him. He was, by nature, inclined to solitude and the study of books.

Al-Malik al-ʿĀdil appointed him as a medical practitioner at the two hospitals in Damascus founded by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn Maḥmūd ibn Zangī. My uncle frequented these two hospitals and the citadel and was paid a salary and allowances. He was also paid a salary as the physician of Sitt al-Shām,

He in turn had been given it by Maʿrūf al-Karkhī, who had inherited it from ʿAlī ibn Mūsā al-Riḍā – upon him be peace. Maʿrūf al-Karkhī accompanied ʿAlī, educated and served him. ʿAlī in his turn had received it from his father, Mūsā ibn Jaʿfar al-Kāẓim, who had been given it by his father Jaʿfar ibn Muḥammad al-Ṣādiq, who had been presented with it by his father Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Bāqir.

                                        Bosra (ancient Bostra) is a town in southern Syria near the border of Jordan, nowadays administratively belonging to the Daraa District of the Daraa Governorate. It used to be an important stopover on the ancient caravan route to Mecca. It, moreover, boasts a magnificent second-century Roman theatre. Some early Christian ruins and several mosques are also found within its great walls. Cf.

My uncle went there and successfully treated the Sultan’s mother, who felt well again within the shortest possible time, whereupon, he was presented with gold and honorary robes. Shortly thereafter, however, he was stricken with an acute fever, which grew steadily worse, even after his return to Damascus. The best and most venerated physicians tried to cure him, but his time had come. He died – may God have mercy upon him – in the second hour of Monday, the seventeenth of Shaʿbān, of the year 616 [28 October 1219], at the age of 38. He was buried near his father and brother outside the Gate of Paradise.

                                <item>Exhortation for the beginning of the day: ‘This day has come, in which you are prepared to do all kinds of things. Choose to perform the finest deeds, so that you will be able to reach the highest of ranks. You should do good, for that will bring you nearer to God and endear you to men. Beware of evil, for it will keep you away from God and make people hate you’.</item>

                                <item>Do that which will give you credit at the end of the day, and beware that the evil part of your nature does not overpower the good part. A virtuous person is not the one who remains in his natural state in the absence of harmful influences, but rather the one who remains in that state despite the presence of harmful influences; to stay away from people is the best preventive against harm.</item>

                                <item>Be truthful, for a lie makes a man feel inferior in his own eyes, let alone in the eyes of others.</item>

                                <item>Be gentle and you will be thanked and honoured, for hatred quickly brings about anguish and causes enmity and evil, just as envy does.</item>

Do unto people as you would like them to do unto you. Beware of anger and the sudden impulse to take revenge on an angry man or to dissociate from him, for you may come to regret it; you should be patient, for patience is the principal part of all wisdom.</item>

Now this night has come, in which you do not have a necessary physical task to fulfil, so turn towards the things that are beneficial for you, by studying the sciences, and by reflecting on the knowledge of the true sense of things; as long as you can stay awake, do this; when you are feeling sleepy, concentrate on the subject of your concern, so that your dreams may also be of the same nature.

                                <item>Beware of being allured by your innate nature to ponder on what you have seen during the day of the conditions of the rulers of this world, for this will waste your time, open for yourself the gates of deception, trickery and slyness in order to acquire worldly goods, corrupt your soul and impair your status, keep you far removed from the true essence of things and let you acquire those shameful traits of character that are so difficult to cast off. But know that these [matters] are transient and useless accidents, and that the needs of man are very few.</item>

                                <item>Reflect on the things that might be useful to you and stand ready to meet God, for the knowledge of the time of your death is concealed from you, and your expectation of living another day is stronger than your imagination of dying tonight; so in saying farewell you should cling to those things that will benefit you after [your] departure. Peace be upon you.</item>

                                <item>Respect your teachers, even if they kept silent and did not answer your questions. Perhaps that was because they learned things long ago (and have forgotten them), or because of weariness, or because you asked something that is not of your concern, or because they believed that you would not understand the answer; know that the benefit you will derive from them is greater than all of this.</item>

                                    Diseases have their own duration, and remedies need the help of fate. The art of medicine is largely mere conjecture and assessment, in which certainty is a rare occurrence.

                                    Its two parts are analogy and experience, not sophistry and love of dominance; the purpose of medicine is the preservation of health when it is present and its recovery when it has been lost; in these two things a sound natural disposition and subtle thought become evident, and by them you can distinguish between the one whose work is effective and the ignorant, the excellent scholar and the idle one, the one who acts according to analogy and experience and the one who only seeks for wealth and prestige.

It should be noted that the English translations offer scope for ambiguities not present in Arabic, because in English many ordinals and fractions are homonyms (e.g. ‘tenth’ standing for

                            <p>The esteemed, learned and complete physician Badr al-Dīn al-Muẓaffar was the son of the judge and learned authority Majd al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Ibrāhīm. Although his father was the judge of Baʿlabakk, Badr al-Dīn grew up in Damascus, where he studied the art of medicine. God brought together in him an exceeding amount of knowledge, intelligence and virtue. He studied the art of medicine under our shaykh, the physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ibn ʿAlī – may God have mercy upon him – and attained to the utmost perfection within the shortest possible time in both its theoretical and practical aspects. Badr al-Dīn was a highly ambitious student, and his soul contained all good qualities. I found that he studied with a single-mindedness unmatched by any other students. Moreover, there were no physicians who were equal to him. He strove continually to increase his knowledge and his pursuit of learning and understanding, memorizing many medical books and philosophical works.</p>
                            <p>
                                I was myself a witness of an instance of his high ambition and great talent. The shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ibn ʿAlī had composed a treatise on vomiting.

                                        This treatise has been mentioned in the entry on Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ibn ʿAlī (Ch. 15.50). It was composed in the month of Rabīʿ
                                        <hi rend="smallcaps">I</hi>
                                        of the year 622/1225.

                                Each of his disciples studied it with him, but Badr al-Dīn proceeded to memorize it and studied it on his own initiative, from beginning to end. The shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was delighted at this, and Badr al-Dīn became his pupil, assiduously reading and studying under his guidance.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the year 622/1225, when the physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn travelled to the lands of the East in order to enter the service of al-Malik al-Ashraf Mūsā, the son of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, he was accompanied by Badr al-Dīn, who continued to study with him. As a result, the younger man worked in the hospital of al-Raqqah and composed a beautiful treatise on the climate, weather conditions and predominant [characteristics] of al-Raqqah. He lived in al-Raqqah for some years and studied philosophy there under the guidance of Zayn al-Dīn, the blind – may God have mercy upon him – who was an authority in the philosophical sciences.</p>
                            <p>Later, however, Badr al-Dīn went back to Damascus. When al-Malik al-Jawād Muẓaffar al-Dīn Yūnus, the son of Shams al-Dīn Mawdūd, the son of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, conquered Damascus in the year 635/1237, he invited Badr al-Dīn to enter his service. He enjoyed the good favour of the Sultan, and obtained an important position in his government. Al-Malik al-Jawād depended upon him in medical matters and appointed him chief of all the physicians, oculists and surgeons, confirming the appointment with a decree in the month Ṣafar of the year 637 [September 1239].</p>
                            <p>Thanks to his continuous desire to do good works and his incessant concern for the benefits of the art, Badr al-Dīn revived some of the benefits of medicine that had been lost, and brought back certain of its virtues that had long been forgotten. One of his most excellent achievements, one that had a long-lasting effect and won him the highest [deserved] reward, was his persistent effort to buy a number of houses adjacent to the ‘Great Hospital’ that had been founded and dedicated as a religious endowment by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn Maḥmūd ibn Zangī – may God have mercy upon him. Badr al-Dīn worked very hard to that end and paid for the houses with his own money. In the end, having acquired them, he had them incorporated into the hospital: small rooms were enlarged and converted into wards for the patients. Badr al-Dīn built them in the best possible way, with their walls plastered and running water installed, so that the hospital was improved by his most noble action.</p>
                            <p>Badr al-Dīn continued to teach medicine, and he also served al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb, the son of al-Malik al-Kāmil, treating him and his family in the ruler’s quarters in the fort of Damascus, as well as others who took refuge there, while visiting the hospital from time to time to treat patients there as well. Al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ gave the physician a written certificate, appointing him chief physician of Damascus, in the year 645/1247. Badr al-Dīn also attended several of the successors of al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ who ruled over Damascus, thanks to whom he enjoyed a permanent salary, an important position, great prestige and the highest favours. He continued to frequent the citadel and the hospital, while increasing his knowledge in his leisure time.</p>
                            <p>Badr al-Dīn’s high ambition and noble origins are shown, as I found, by the fact that he devoted himself completely to the science of religious law. He had a room at the Qilījiyyah Law College, which had been dedicated as a charitable endowment by the emir Sayf al-Dīn ʿAlī ibn Qilīj – may God have mercy upon him – and was located next door to the physician’s house. He studied books on jurisprudence and the literary arts, learnt the Qur’an perfectly by heart, and came to know its commentaries and its various readings until he became an outstanding expert in that domain, in which his teacher was the shaykh and authority Shihāb al-Dīn Abū Shāmah – may God have mercy upon him.</p>
                            <p>
                                The physician Badr al-Dīn devoted himself whole-heartedly to worship and religion and being of assistance to other Muslims. Accounts of his virtue and kindness continued to reach me. One day, one of his works,

                                        <hi rend="italic">The Soul’s Gladdener</hi>
                                        , the supplier of joy and togetherness, with which he has surpassed the ancients and rendered powerless all other physicians and philosophers, and with which he has changed the remedies for the heart and become the leader in charge of this lofty mission. No wonder that there is no one similar to him: our master and shaykh of [our] times, the symbol of our generation. May God render his life full of happiness and fill the earth with his writings, so that many will be able to derive benefit from them.

                                        May God prolong the days of the sublime authority, the illustrious master, the learned physician, the great and virtuous leader, the sign of his time, the unique one of his age, the full moon of this world and of religion, the supporter of kings and sultans, the intimate friend of the emir of the Faithful. May God watch over his Excellency, offer him his full protection in both worlds, suppress his desires and subdue his enemies. May happiness always reign in his home and may tongues never cease to unite in thanking and praising him. The servant ends by [expressing] his great yearning to serve [Badr al-Dīn]. If he had had the eloquence of the supreme shaykh and the lengthy manner of expressing himself of the virtuous Galen, still he would have been unable to describe the sorrow of his yearnings and the pain that he suffers because of this farewell. He prays humbly to God, exalted be He, to facilitate their joyous meeting and make the encounter easy for them both with regard to their mutual preferences. When your servant heard, O master, that you had been appointed chief of all physicians – God, exalted be He, granted them special favours through that appointment and bestowed upon them ample benefits – he attained the summit of happiness, set his mind to extreme joy, and realized that God, exalted be He, had indeed kept a benevolent eye on His flock and united them under his good care. Herewith, this art was raised in importance and its light spread. It received the greatest honours, virtues, fortune and brilliant splendour. For that reason, the period in which we live, is ennobled by the art [of medicine] more than other periods [in history], and the status of science is now contrary to what was once described by Ibn al-Khaṭīb in [his commentary on] the

May [God] continue to accord our master the best wishes, as long as he is still aware of the breath of life in him. May He well reward him, as long as his firm roots do not become untied, but continue to expand and be manifold. May He still continue to promulgate his praises in the seats of splendour. May the praises, whose beautiful exterior never ceases to be, be adorned and shine. May He curb my yearnings and longings, which cannot be contained in words, nor encompassed by pages. Yet, [the servant] relies on our master’s grasp of knowledge, his sincere love and friendship and his deep trust in his supporters and companions. I received my father’s letter with the glad tidings, which filled his heart with joy and his soul with delight, of our master’s appointment as chief of all the other physicians and of his good care and benevolent treatment of them. My father had described our master’s favours and generosity toward him, and that he was well-known for his kindness and celebrated for his virtues and his benevolence. Our master, who knows best the paths of honour and the fact that evil men consider knowledge blameworthy, may he receive help from God to remain forever doing good, excelling in noble things, reaching the highest ranks, obtaining perpetual happiness and being protected from evil.

He went to the root of things and acquired a good understanding of their meaning, and it was for that reason that he came to be known as al-Kullī (‘the Generalist’). In addition, Shams al-Dīn studied many scientific works and became a medical practitioner. He had a keen intelligence and possessed much knowledge, never wasting a moment, but studying and practising science under all circumstances. Shams al-Dīn’s appearance was pleasing and his conversation rather witty. He served as personal physician to al-Malik al-Ashraf Mūsā, the son of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, in Damascus, until that ruler died – may God have mercy upon him. Afterwards, he practised for some time at the ‘Great Hospital’ that had been founded by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn ibn Zangī – may God have mercy upon him – visiting it frequently and treating the patients there.

Brown-skinned and of slender built, he had a sharp mind and was highly intelligent and eloquent: no one could equal him in research or match him in debate. He studied the art of medicine under the guidance of our master, the physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ibn ʿAlī,

His writings are witty and well composed, as he was also outstanding in the literary sciences. He composed epistles and poetry, knew how to play the lute, and had a fine handwriting.

For a time he enjoyed his patron’s favour and was appointed vizier, but eventually the ruler became hostile toward him and confiscated all his belongings. As a result, he removed to Damascus and settled there. Many came to study the art of medicine under his guidance, and he became a distinguished citizen. Al-Ṣāḥib Jamāl al-Dīn ibn Maṭrūḥ wrote him the following poem in answer to a letter that Najm al-Dīn had sent him:

                                Najm al-Dīn – may God have mercy upon him – was, because of his sharp temperament, an impatient individual and it seldom happened that he displayed amiable behaviour. A group of people envied him his accomplishments and sought to harm him. One day he quoted the following poem to me:

                                from the tribe of Aws, was born in the year 600/1203 in Damascus, where he grew up to become the most erudite man of his time and the cynosure of his generation. ʿIzz al-Dīn unites in himself all the virtues: outstanding excellence, noble ancestry, perfect manliness and boundless generosity, and he is a guardian of brotherliness. He studied the art of medicine until he reached the utmost perfection in it, such as was never attained by any other master. He is well-versed in the universals and particulars of medicine, and used to frequent the best physicians and the greatest philosophers, among them our shaykh, the physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ibn ʿAlī, and others, from whom he learnt medical usages and philosophical secrets.

                            <p>ʿIzz al-Dīn has also studied the literary sciences, attaining the highest rank in that domain, and distinguishing himself in knowledge of the Arabic language. There is no poet who can equal him: ancients and contemporaries alike fail to attain his status. His poetry contains eloquent phrases, truthful meanings, well-constructed puns and amazing parallels. He unites in himself all the different sciences and all varieties of prose and poetry. He is the quickest of men in composing poetry spontaneously and the most gifted in declaiming it. Several times I have witnessed him reciting a poem, rich in allusions, that he had composed on the spur of the moment. There is no one who can match him, for that art is his speciality.</p>

                                ʿIzz al-Dīn’s father – may God have mercy upon him – was a merchant from al-Suwaydāʾ in the Ḥawrān, a man with a fine character, noble origins, gentle speech and good deeds. Between him and my father there was a firm and praiseworthy friendship. I myself studied with ʿIzz al-Dīn at the school of shaykh Abū Bakr al-Ṣiqillī – may God have mercy upon him. Our long-standing friendship remained the same throughout the years, and has even grown steadily with time. The physician ʿIzz al-Dīn is indeed the most illustrious physician of his generation with respect to his knowledge and memory, treatment and amicability, beneficial cures and precise methods. He is still practising as a doctor at the al-Nūrī hospital, granting patients their ultimate desire by taking away their maladies and according them the finest gift by supplying them with health. He has also served at the hospital in [the Damascene district of] Bāb al-Barīd,

                                ʿIzz al-Dīn has copied in his own handwriting a great many books on medicine and works in other sciences. Some of these are written in accordance with the method of Ibn al-Bawwāb, whereas others resemble

Each of these scripts is more radiant than the most sparkling stars, brighter than the most sumptuous jewels, finer than the prettiest gardens and filled with more light than the rising sun. ʿIzz al-Dīn once told me that he had copied three versions of Ibn Sīnā’s

                                . In the year 632/1234 a merchant from Persia arrived in Damascus, bringing with him a copy of Ibn Abī Ṣādiq’s

He let me listen to some of his poetry, original qua meaning, unusual in purpose, containing various kinds of paronomasia and types of antithesis, eloquent phrases and motifs. As to medicine, he distinguished himself in it more than any of the ancients or his contemporaries, whereas in literature he was unrivalled by any poet or prose-writer. In addition to this, he was the singular man of his time and the leader of his generation in the science of religious law, according to school of Imām al-Shāfiʿī. He had travelled from Dunaysir to Egypt and from there to Syria and settled in Damascus, where he served the palaces of al-Malik al-Nāṣir Yūsuf in the fort of the city. He also frequented the Great Hospital of al-Nūrī in Damascus.

Here, however, the original lines seem to have been cherry-picked, cento-like, from several poets. The first two italicized lines are the opening lines of a long ode by Sibṭ ibn al-Taʿāwīdhī (d. 584/1188); see his

                                        <hi rend="italic">Kashkūl</hi>
                                        , 638, and the last two lines are from a poem by Abū Shās, quoted in al-Shābushtī,

                            <p>Muwaffaq al-Dīn Yaʿqūb al-Sāmirī is the great physician and unique scholar, the leader of his generation and the one man of his time, Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqūb ibn Ghanāʾim. He was born and bred in Damascus. He distinguished himself in the art of medicine, but was also well-versed in the philosophical sciences. His medical knowledge was outstanding in both theory and practice, as it encompassed all its universals and particulars. He was praised for his medical treatment and deserved acknowledgment for his amicable behaviour, which was flattering when he was among the notables and distinguished at all other times. He was a strong adherent of the restoration and maintenance of bodily health. A large group of physicians used to study under his guidance and many students benefited from his knowledge. His writings contain intelligible language and sound allusions and are well-composed and deeply meaningful.</p>
                            <p>Muwaffaq al-Dīn Yaʿqūb al-Sāmirī wrote the following books:</p>

                            <p>The great and learned physician Amīn al-Dawlah Abū l-Faraj, the son of the incomparable and learned shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn ibn Isḥāq ibn al-Quff, was a Christian from al-Karak, having been born in al-Karak on Saturday, the thirteenth of Dhū l-Qaʿdah of the year 630 [21 August 1233].</p>
                            <p>His father, Muwaffaq al-Dīn, was a friend of mine, who always placed special emphasis on his friendship with me and upheld it throughout his life. His company was precious to me, and his geniality was a delightful feast. He was the light of his generation and the most quick-minded person of his period. Muwaffaq al-Dīn was unequalled at memorizing poetry, and was an authority in the transmission of historical information and other facts. He distinguished himself in his knowledge of the Arabic language and was outstanding in the literary arts, combining in himself the practical and theoretical applications of penmanship and second to none in dealing with figures of speech and unusual meanings. Furthermore, his well-proportioned handwriting was a pleasure to the eyes, unmatched by copyists from other cities and countries. During the reign of al-Malik al-Nāṣir Yūsuf ibn Muḥammad he was a scribe in Ṣarkhad, working in the bureau of charitable relief services.</p>
                            <p>
                                His son Abū l-Faraj showed signs of excellence from his early youth, and this was confirmed at a later age. He possessed good manners and rarely spoke, was broad-minded, and loved to hear tales about the lives of the learned. His father wanted him to learn the art of medicine, and asked me to become his teacher. Abū l-Faraj stayed with me until he had memorized the principal works that are commonly memorized by students, such as

He learnt how to comment on their thematic purport and came to understand the principles of their composition, and afterwards studied, under my guidance, the [part on] medical treatment in the work of Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakariyyā al-Rāzī. He came to know about the types of illnesses and the most significant diseases occurring in [human] bodies, became familiar with what precedes the treatment of patients, and spent effort on the treatment itself. I taught him the basics and the various parts of that domain, and made him understand its mysteries and benefits.

                                Abū l-Faraj’s father later moved to Damascus the well-guarded, where he held a high administrative post. His son accompanied him there, and attended the company of a group of learned scholars in a variety of sciences, studying the natural sciences and the parts of philosophy under the guidance of the shaykh Shams al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Ḥamīd al-Khusrawshāhī and ʿIzz al-Dīn al-Ḥasan al-Ghanawī al-Ḍarīr. Abū l-Faraj also studied the art of medicine with the physician Najm al-Dīn ibn Minfākh and with Muwaffaq al-Dīn Yaʿqūb, the Samaritan. In addition, he studied Euclid’s

Beneath the colophon in A is the following note: ‘The copyist says: Praise be to God and blessing on His prophet and his family. I have meticulously collated this copy with the copy of the author to the best of my efforts. Then I found in the draft of the author, in his handwriting, things that he had not included in the autographed exemplar that he presented and dedicated to important people, so I included this in order to preserve what he reports and to encompass all knowledge. I reached up to [the biography of] al-Ṣāḥib Amīn al-Dawlah [al-Ghazāl] and I found that this copy had many additions in the biography under this name and in the following. I abandoned the collation from this point onwards, since there is no extra material.’
