                                    <hi rend="italic">ḥāshiyah</hi>
                                    reads: ‘The writer of this [marginal note] said: I found in the draft of the author (
                                    <hi rend="italic">musawwadat al-muṣannif</hi>
                                    ) names that were not in the exemplar copy (

                                    ). And the exemplar (

                                    ) is a copy that was transcribed from a copy also written by the author [Ibn Abī Usaybiʿah] in his own hand. It occurred to me that he [Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah?] omitted names in the fair copy (
                                    <hi rend="italic">al-mubayyaḍah</hi>
                                    ) either because he intended to compose an abridgement, since they [the omitted names] are of no benefit or for some other reason. I did not want this copy [
                                    <hi rend="smallcaps">MS</hi>
                                    A] to lack a single name from amongst those found in the draft [of the author]. And I have included in the preceding chapters of this book [
                                    <hi rend="smallcaps">MS</hi>
                                    A] whatever was not present in the exemplar. In this copy [
                                    <hi rend="smallcaps">MS</hi>
                                    A] [I have included] each name at the point where the author [Ibn Abī Usaybiʿah] mentioned it in his draft (
                                    <hi rend="italic">fī musawwadatihi</hi>
                                    ), out of concern that the copyist of his [Ibn Abī Usaybiʿah’s] fair copy had [inadvertently] omitted them. And now it occurred to me that I should include all of the names present in the author’s draft (
                                    <hi rend="italic">musawwadah</hi>
                                    ) following one another in lists (

                                    ) and indicate their positions [in the text] as far as I am capable and able to do so. From God I ask assistance in this.’ For a discussion of this

                            Politianus (Balīṭīyān) was made Patriarch of Alexandria in the fourth year of the reign of the Abbasid caliph al-Manṣūr, remaining in that office for forty-six years until his death,

                                    The fourth year of the reign of al-Manṣūr began in 140/757–758, and if Politianus served for 46 years until his death, it would mean that he died in 186/802, a date which coincides with that given at the end of the entry. However, other sources suggest that Politianus was made Patriarch of Alexandria in 151/768 and that he died in 197/813; see Skreslet,

                            to al-Rashīd, who grew to love her very much. One day, she became very ill. The physicians treated her but were unable to cure her. They said to al-Rashīd, ‘Have ʿUbayd Allāh, your governor in Egypt, send to you one of the physicians of Egypt, since they know more about how to treat an Egyptian slave girl than the physicians of Iraq.’ So al-Rashīd ordered ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Mahdī to choose someone from amongst the most skilled physicians of Egypt to treat the concubine. ʿUbayd Allāh called upon Politianus, the Patriarch of Alexandria, who was skilled in medicine, and told him of al-Rashīd’s love for the girl and her illness, and conducted Politianus to al-Rashīd. Politianus carried with him some of the coarse cake and small salted fish of Egypt, and when he arrived in Baghdad and attended to the slave girl, he gave her the cake and small salted fish to eat, whereupon she was cured of her illness.

                        <p>From that time on, the coarse cake and small salted fish were imported from Egypt to the imperial storehouses in Baghdad. The caliph al-Rashīd rewarded Politianus with ample wealth and issued a decree ordering that every church that had been taken from the Melkites by the Jacobites should revert back into the possession of the Melkites. Politianus returned to Egypt and reclaimed many churches from the Jacobites.</p>
                        <p>Politianus died in the year 186/802.</p>

Sending for al-Ḥasan ibn Zīrak, he said to him: ‘I believe what you prescribed for me today was not correct’. To which al-Ḥasan ibn Zīrak replied: ‘Let the emir, may God help him, summon all the physicians of Fustat to his residence in the early morning each day, so that they can reach a consensus as to what the emir should take that morning. I have administered nothing to you except those things whose composition merits your confidence, and all of them stimulate the retentive faculty in your stomach and liver.’ ‘By God,’ answered Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn, ‘if you do not succeed in the treatment of my illness, I will cut off your head. You are experimenting on a sick person and nothing truthful is to be gained by doing that.’

Ibn Ṭūlūn became angry, and when Saʿīd appeared, the emir upbraided him for his lateness, but, in disdain, refrained from complaining to Saʿīd about what ailed him. Then the following night, the emir’s illness worsened and he sent for Saʿīd, who arrived slightly inebriated.

                                    Saʿīd ibn Tawfīl, the physician, was in the service of the emir, Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn. One day, Ibn Ṭūlūn summoned him but was informed that Saʿīd had gone away to inspect some property he intended to buy. Ibn Ṭūlūn refrained from reacting until Saʿīd returned, but then the emir said to him, ‘O Saʿīd, instead of the property you wish to buy and benefit from, think about your friendship with me and tend to its cultivation and do not neglect it. Know that you’d better die before me, for if I should die in my bed [while you are still living], I shall not be in a position to allow you to enjoy your life after I am gone.’

His name was Hāshim and he tended to Saʿīd’s mule and would look after it when Saʿīd was in attendance on Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn. Occasionally when they returned, Saʿīd employed Hāshim in pulverizing drugs at his house, and Hāshim would stoke the fires under the medicinal decoctions. Saʿīd ibn Tawfīl had a very handsome and intelligent son who was well-versed in medicine. One day, early in their association, Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn instructed Saʿīd to find a physician for the women’s quarters, one who would be present during Saʿīd’s absence. Saʿīd told him: ‘I have a son whom I have taught and trained.’ Ibn Ṭūlūn said, ‘Let me see him.’ Saʿīd brought him to the ruler, and Ibn Ṭūlūn saw a handsome youth possessed of all admirable qualities. ‘But he is not suitable for service in the women’s quarters,’ Ibn Tulūn said to Saʿīd, ‘for someone of sound knowledge but ugly appearance is required for them.’ As a result Saʿīd was afraid that Ibn Ṭūlūn would bring in a stranger who would contradict and oppose him. So, Saʿīd took Hāshim and dressed him in a

But you have disgraced the profession. By God, Abū ʿUthmān Saʿīd ibn Tawfīl, if he becomes established, he may revert to the baseness of his rank and low-class origins.’ At these words, Saʿīd laughed heedlessly. In the event, Hāshim established himself securely in the women’s quarters by preparing beneficial potions for fatness, pregnancy, maintaining good complexions and growing luxuriant hair – so much so that the women preferred Hāshim to Saʿīd.</p>

When he came before the emir, Hāshim looked directly at him and said: ‘The emir has been neglected, resulting in his present condition. May God not reward the one who is responsible for this matter.’

                                    Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn said to him, ‘What is the right course of action, O blessed one?’ ‘You should take a small dose, in which there is such and such,’ Hāshim replied, and he listed nearly one hundred items that have a binding effect at the time they are taken, but are harmful later because they deplete the body’s strength. So Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn took the medicine and abandoned what Saʿīd and the other physicians had made for him. When it caused constipation, Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn was pleased and thought his recovery was complete. Then he said to Hāshim, ‘Saʿīd had prohibited me this past month from having even a morsel of porridge

Porridge is nourishing and has a good effect on you.’ So, Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn ordered its preparation and it was brought in a large bowl, most of which he ate, and he was happy to have satisfied his cravings. Then he lay down to sleep. The porridge stuck fast [thus stopping the diarrhoea], so he imagined that his condition had improved.

                                <p>All of this was concealed from Saʿīd ibn Tawfīl. When Saʿīd appeared, Ibn Ṭūlūn questioned him: ‘What have you to say about porridge?’ Saʿīd replied: ‘It weighs heavily on the organs and the emir’s organs need something that will lighten them.’ Aḥmad said to him, ‘Spare me this foolishness! I have already eaten it and it has proved beneficial to me, God be praised.’ Fruit having arrived from Syria, Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn asked Saʿīd ibn Tawfīl’s view on quinces. Saʿīd answered, ‘Suck on them on an empty stomach and empty bowels, for then they will then be of benefit.’ When Saʿīd had left him, Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn ate some quinces, but the quinces encountered the porridge and pushed it and so caused another bout of diarrhoea. Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn summoned Saʿīd and said, ‘You son of a whore! You said that quinces would be beneficial to me but the loose bowel movements have returned.’ Saʿīd got up to examine the stools and returned to him, saying: ‘This porridge, which you praised and which you said I was wrong to prohibit, remained in your intestines, which, because of their weakness, were unable to alter or digest it until the quince pushed it through. I did not prescribe that you eat the quinces, rather I advised sucking on them.’ Then he asked how many quinces he had eaten, to which Ibn Ṭūlūn replied ‘two.’ Saʿīd said: ‘You ate the quinces to satisfy yourself and not as a course of treatment’. ‘You son of a whore!’ Ibn Ṭūlūn retorted, ‘you sit there making sport of me while you are perfectly healthy and I am seriously ill.’ Then he called for whips and gave Saʿīd two hundred lashes and had him led around on a camel, with a crier proclaiming ‘This is the reward of one who was trusted but was disloyal.’</p>

Isḥāq was held in high regard by al-Muʿizz, who put him in charge of his affairs during the lifetime of Isḥāq’s father, Mūsā. Isḥāq ibn Mūsā died on the twelfth night of the month of Ṣafar in the year 363 [10 November 973]. The caliph, al-Muʿizz was distressed at the death of Isḥāq, who had served his master so well. Al-Muʿizz granted Isḥāq’s position to Isḥāq’s brother, Ismāʿīl ibn Mūsā and, succeeding him, Isḥāq’s son Yaʿqūb ibn Isḥāq. All this happened during the lifetime of their father, Mūsā. There was another brother [of Isḥāq] who was a Muslim, named ʿAwn Allāh ibn Mūsā. He died one day before Isḥāq.

                            Saʿīd ibn al-Biṭrīq became Patriarch of Alexandria and took the name Eutychius. That occurred on the eighth day of the month of Ṣafar in the year 321 [7 Feb 933], when he was close to sixty years of age. He remained in the patriarchal see and in authority for seven years and six months. But great dissension occurred during his incumbency, and there was continual strife between him and his community.

                            While in Old Cairo, Saʿīd ibn al-Biṭrīq became ill with diarrhoea (

                            ). Distinguished as he was in the art of medicine, he suspected that the illness would cause his death. He therefore returned to his see in Alexandria, remaining ill there for a number of days and finally dying on a Monday, the last day of the month of Rajab of the year 328 [11 May 940].

                                    Muḥammad al-Tamīmī was from Jerusalem, and he studied medicine there and in other cities to which he travelled. As a result, he became very learned, perfecting his knowledge to a very high standard. He was keenly interested in the preparation of remedies and the selection of appropriate ingredients. It was al-Tamīmī who perfected the theriac called

                                <p>My father, may God be pleased with him, told me that once he got excessively drunk and that this impaired his reasoning abilities to the point that he fell from a considerable height to the floor of an inn where he was staying. He was not conscious, and the innkeeper attended to him and carried him to his own living quarters. When my father awoke and rose, he felt pain and weakness in several parts of his body. He did not know what might have caused the pain, so he rode off, attending to matters until noontime. Then he returned to the inn and said to the innkeeper, ‘I have intense pain and weakness in my body and I do not know the reason for it.’ ‘You should thank God you are still alive’, said the innkeeper. ‘Why?’ my father asked. ‘Don’t you know what happened to you yesterday?’ said the innkeeper. When my father said he did not, the innkeeper said: ‘You fell from the highest place in the inn onto the floor while you were drunk.’ ‘From where?’, my father asked, and the innkeeper showed him the place. When he saw it, pain and throbbing began immediately, so much so that he could not endure it. He began to shout and groan until a physician was sent for, who opened a vein and bled him. The physician also bound up his bruised joints with bandages. It was many days before my father recovered and the pain had ceased.</p>

                            I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say that there is a similar story. A certain merchant, on one of his travels, was in a desert with his fellow-travellers, staying at a place on the way where they had stopped. He slept, while his companions were sitting around him. A snake emerged from somewhere and, happening upon the man’s foot unexpectedly, bit him and then slithered away. The merchant woke up in terror from the pain, clutched his foot and groaned. One of the others said to him, ‘Nothing has happened except that you extended your foot so quickly when you brushed against a thorn at the spot which is causing you pain’, and he pretended to remove the thorn, saying, ‘No injury remains.’ The pain subsided after that, and they all continued on their way. After some time, on their return journey, they came back and stopped to rest there. His companion said to him ‘Do you know what caused the pain which befell you in this place?’ The man replied that he did not. His companion said, ‘A snake bit your foot and we saw it but did not tell you.’ Immediately, an intense pain began in the man’s foot and penetrated into his body until it approached his heart and he lost consciousness. Then his condition steadily worsened until he died. The reason for that was that fears (
                            <hi rend="italic">awhām</hi>
                            ) and psychological events (
                            <hi rend="italic">al-aḥdāth al-nafsāniyyah</hi>
                            ) can have a strong effect on the body. When the man realized that his injury had been a snake bite, he was affected by that idea, and the remaining poison in his body at that spot spread through his body. When it reached his heart, it killed him.

                            Al-Ḥaqīr al-Nāfiʿ was a Jewish physician from Egypt during the reign of al-Ḥākim. He was a wound specialist (

                            he used to make a living by treating wounds while he was relatively unknown. It so happened that al-Ḥākim had a very old wound on one of his legs that would not heal. Ibn Muqashshir,

                            one of al-Ḥākim’s physicians who enjoyed particular favour with him, and other court physicians collaborated in treating him, but their efforts merely made his condition worse. One day this Jewish physician was brought to him. After examining al-Ḥākim, al-Ḥaqīr al-Nāfiʿ applied a dessicating powder (

                            ) on the area which dried out the wound and cured it in three days. So al-Ḥākim bestowed on him one thousand dinars as well as a robe of honour, and gave him the honorific name al-Ḥaqīr al-Nāfiʿ (‘the humble one who is of great benefit’). Al-Ḥākim also appointed him one of his court physicians.

It is described in an anonymous Egyptian cosmography of the 5th/11th century as being amongst a group of ‘obscure stars that have the appearance of faint lances’, for which Hermes Trismegistus is given as an authority. Given that ʿAlī ibn Sulaymān was said to be an expert in knowledge of the stars and was working in Cairo at the beginning of the 5th/11th century, it seems reasonable that he was discussing a comet described in an Arabic Hermetic treatise circulating in Egypt at that time; see Rapoport &amp; Savage-Smith,

                                    is in five parts, which will be indicated in the formatting of this section: Parts 1, 2 and 3 include biographical information about Ibn al-Haytham taken from earlier sources such as Ibn al-Qifṭī. Following this, Part 4 presents an autobiography that Ibn al-Haytham completed at the end of the year 417/Feb 1027, which includes a two-part list of his writings up to that date, transcribed from Ibn al-Haytham’s own handwriting. In Part 5.1 there is another list of his compositions completed between the end of Dhū l-Ḥijjah 417 and at the end of Jumādā

                            He was constantly absorbed in study, prolific as an author, very ascetic, and dedicated to doing good. He summarized and commented upon many of the works of Aristotle. Similarly, he condensed many of Galen’s books on medicine and became an expert in the fundamentals of the art of medicine, as well as its rules and general principles. Even though he did not practise medicine and did not have training in medical treatment, his many works were very useful. He also had good penmanship and a sound knowledge of the Arabic language.

                                    Ibn al-Haytham’s first position was in the district of Basra, where he held the office of vizier. However, he was more interested in ethics and philosophy and the exploration of those domains. So much so, that he desired to rid himself of his duties, which distracted him from the pursuit of learning. Accordingly, he feigned mental confusion and a deterioration of his powers of thought. He maintained that pretence for a period of time until he succeeded in being discharged from service and removed from his duties. He then travelled to Egypt and took up residence in Cairo at al-Azhar Mosque.

Subsequently, al-Ḥākim was informed that Ibn al-Haytham had said, ‘If I were in Egypt, I would conduct work on the Nile that would result in making it useful at all times, during both its rise and fall,

Accordingly, Ibn al-Haytham travelled to Egypt, and when he arrived there, al-Ḥākim came out to receive him. They met in a village near Cairo known as al-Khandaq just outside the gates of al-Mu ʿizz’s city,

For those who had preceded him in ancient times had not lacked the knowledge that he himself possessed, and if the project had been feasible, they would have carried it out. Ibn al-Haytham’s scheme was in ruins and his enthusiasm failed. He went to the place known as ‘the cataracts’ (al-Janādil), south of the city of Aswān.

                                    It is an elevated place from which the waters of the Nile flow down, and here he observed the Nile, studied it, and scouted both banks. As a result, he learned first-hand that his plan could not be executed in a suitable way as he had intended, and he realized the error and the problems associated with what he had promised. Ashamed and prevented from doing what he had intended, Ibn al-Haytham returned and apologized to al-Ḥākim, who appeared to accept this.

                                    Subsequently, al-Ḥākim appointed him a government official. Ibn al-Haytham, however, held his post only out of fear and not out of desire, for he realized he had made an error in accepting office since al-Ḥākim was extremely capricious, spilling blood without cause or for the slightest reason due to some imagined pretext. Ibn al-Haytham pondered the matter, but could not think of a way to get out of his predicament except by displaying madness and disturbance of mind.

The property that had been confiscated under al-Ḥākim was returned to him, and he occupied himself with composing, copying and teaching. Ibn al-Haytham had a particularly precise style of handwriting that he turned to account by transcribing a large number of treatises on mathematics.

                                    Since my childhood, he says, I have continually reflected on the varying beliefs of people, each group of people holding fast to what they believed. But I was doubtful about all of it and was certain that there was only one truth and that the differences are in the approaches towards the truth. When I had completed my acquisition of intellectual matters, I devoted myself to seeking the origin of truth, and I directed my conjectures and my concentration toward the attainment of that by which the falsities (

                                    I directed my resolve toward the attainment of the belief nearest to God, His praise be extolled, leading to God’s approval and obedience to Him and piety. I was in the same position as Galen who in the seventh book of his treatise

                                    , addresses his pupil: ‘I don’t know how it came about – whether I may say it was by wondrous coincidence, or by inspiration from God, or by sheer madness, or through some other means – that I since my youth have despised ordinary people and had little regard for them and ignored them, preferring truth and the acquisition of knowledge. I am certain in my own mind that people cannot acquire anything better in this world, nothing that would bring one closer to God, than these these two matters’.

Kühn, x:457). In this instance Ibn al-Haytham accurately reproduced the Arabic translation of Galen’s treatise by Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq.

                                    I thoroughly investigated a variety of opinions and beliefs, and the several religious sciences, but I found no profit in that, nor did I perceive in it a clear path to the truth nor a sure road to indisputable belief. Rather, I came to realize that I would reach the truth only through doctrines whose constituent elements were perceptible and whose forms were rational. These I found only in Aristotle’s classification of logic, physics, and metaphysics, which constitute the essence and nature of philosophy, where Aristotle begins

He then concentrates on the types of propositions that are the basis and material of the syllogism, designating distinctions between them and discussing the genera and species that make them distinctive, and links this with a discussion of their truth or falsehood, thereafter presenting their agreement, disagreement, opposition, and contradiction.

                                    he discusses the syllogism and the division of its premises, designates its various figures, and classifies those figures. Amongst the classifications, he distinguishes those that are not linked continuously and systematically and sets them apart from those that are so linked. Then he discusses the results that follow from them along with associated fundamental conditions – that is, the necessary, the possible, and the impossible. He explains the approaches to securing premises of syllogisms that are necessary (

                                    In that work, he expresses his interpretation of the soul and refutes the views of everyone who has expressed an idea that differs from his and who holds firm beliefs about its essence other than his own belief. He subdivides the soul into the nutritive, the sensory and the cognitive, and he discusses the conditions of the nutritive, comments upon sensory matters, and explains the reasons for cognition. In this way he discusses every obscure aspect that he has disclosed, explaining every hidden detail.

                                    In it he explains that God is one, that He is wise not ignorant, powerful not weak, and generous not stingy. Thus, Aristotle has judiciously set out the guidelines along which one may travel toward the truth, and so attain to its nature and substance, and find its essence and nature.

                                <p>When I – Ibn al-Haytham – realized that, I devoted all my efforts to studying the philosophical disciplines, which comprise three branches of learning: mathematics, physics, and metaphysics. I therefore concentrated on the fundamentals and principles which govern these three fields and their consequences, and I arrived at a good understanding of them in all their depths and heights. Then I considered the nature of mankind – its association with decay and its susceptibility to destruction and depletion, and how in the vigour of youth a person is able to master the required concepts underlying these basic principles more readily, but when that person reaches old age and the time of senility, his constitution becomes inadequate, his strength weakens, his reasoning power fails and there is deterioration in his ability to do what he had routinely done before.</p>
                                <p>
                                    From these three fundamental subjects (mathematics, physics, metaphysics) I explained in detail, summarized and condensed in an orderly way what I was able to understand and discern. I have drawn upon their assorted contents to compose works that clarify and reveal the obscurities of these three fundamental domains right up to the present time, which is the month of Dhū l-Ḥijjah in the year 417 [January/February1027] of the migration (Hijra) of the Prophet, God bless him and keep him. As long as I live, I will devote all my energy and all my strength to such endeavours with three aims in mind: first, to benefit the person seeking truth and influence him during my lifetime and after my death; second, as an exercise for myself in these matters to confirm what my reflection on these disciplines has formulated and organized; and, third, to create for myself a treasure-house and provision for the time of old age and period of senility. In doing this I have followed what Galen says in the seventh book of his treatise
                                    <hi rend="italic">On the Method of Healing</hi>
                                    : ‘In all my writings, it has been and remains my intention to do one of two things: either to benefit someone through something useful and profitable, or to benefit myself through mental exercise, by which I enjoy myself at the time of my writing it and [at the same time] make a store-house for the time of old age’.

                                        A town on the river Kārūn (or Dujayl, the ‘small Tigris’) in Khūzistān, a province of southwestern Persia. Situated halfway between Baghdad and Shiraz, it was an important commercial town and centre for trade in the early centuries of Islam. It had a large sugar industry and an important silk industry. However, it was known for its heat and insalubrious climate, where one could easily catch fevers and where insects, fleas, scorpions, and serpents abounded. Ibn al-Haytham seems to be unusual in advocating the natural conditions of al-Ahwāz over those of Baghdad, though perhaps he was advocating its location on the river for supporting large mills on pontoon boats rather than its healthy climate.

                                    Then I – Ibn al-Haytham – attached [a list] of everything I had composed regarding the knowledge of the Ancients to an essay in which I made clear that all worldly as well as religious matters are consequences of the philosophical sciences. This essay was the final one in my numbered discourses on these disciplines, being the seventieth. That total excludes a number of letters and compositions that have passed from me into the hands of certain people in Basra and al-Ahwāz, for which the originals have been lost, and which I have been prevented from copying by preoccupation with worldly affairs and the disruption of travel, as frequently happens to scholars. A similar misfortune befell Galen, and he even mentions this in one of his books, where he says: ‘I had composed many books whose originals I had handed over to a group of my colleagues, but work and travel prevented me from copying them until they had become dispersed.’

                                        Ibn Rāwandī, (b. at the beginning of the 3rd/9th cent.; death date uncertain) was a follower of Muʿtazilism at first and then later became an ardent opponent of that school of thought. He was known for a biting criticism of prophecy in general and of the prophecy of Muḥammad in particular. In addition, he maintained that religious dogmas are not subject to reason and must, therefore, be rejected and that miracles attributed to the prophets – persons who may reasonably be compared to sorcerers and magicians – are pure invention. The Qur’an, he held, is neither a revealed book nor even an inimitable literary masterpiece. In order to cloak these theses, he used the fiction that they were uttered by the Brahmans. Several generations of Muslim theologians devoted themselves to refuting his attacks, including Abū ʿAlī al-Jubbāʾī and his son Abū Hāshim; see

                            The significant works of al-Mubashshir ibn Fātik on logic and other branches of learning are renowned among scholars. He was a prolific writer and I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – have found many books in his handwriting concerned with the writings of the Ancients. Ibn Fātik acquired a very large number of books, most of which still exist, although their pages have become discoloured due to immersion in water.

                                <p>The emir, Ibn Fātik, desired to attain knowledge and had a large library. He was constantly occupied only with study and writing, and most of the time, even when engaged in travel, he could not bear to forsake his books, for he believed that they were more important than anything else that he possessed. He had a wife of high status who was also from the ruling class. When al-Mubashshir ibn Fātik died, may God have mercy upon him, his wife, accompanied by her slave girls, betook herself to his library. She was resentful of the books because of the time he spent with them, all the while neglecting her. While lamenting him, she and the servant girls threw the books into a big pool of water in the courtyard. The books were subsequently retrieved from the water, but by then most of them had become waterlogged. And so that is the reason why most of the books of al-Mubashshir ibn Fātik are in their present condition.</p>

                                <p>It is appropriate for every person to take up the profession most suitable for him. The art of medicine is closest to philosophy with regard to obedience to God, the Mighty and Glorious. The astrological signs at my birth indicated that medicine should be my profession. Moreover, a life of merit is more pleasing to me than any other. I undertook the study of medicine when I was a boy of fifteen years, but it will be best to relate to you the entire story:</p>
                                <p>
                                    I was born in Old Cairo at a locality situated at 30° latitude and 55° longitude.

                                            While the determination of latitude for a given locality was relatively consistent in the medieval geographical tables, the value for longitude could vary considerably, depending upon the position taken for the prime meridian. For various localities through which a prime meridian was calculated, see Tibbetts, ‘Beginning of a Cartographic Tradition’, 103–105. In forty-three preserved medieval Arabic tables of geographical coordinates recording a value for Miṣr (Old Cairo), the longitude varies between 51° and 65°.

                                    At the age of six, I began to devote myself to study, and when I was ten, I moved to the capital [Cairo] and concentrated even more on learning. When I reached the age of fourteen, I undertook the study of medicine and philosophy but since I had no money to support myself, studying was difficult and troublesome for me. Sometimes I made a living by practising the art of astrology,

I continued in that way, exerting all my efforts in learning, until I was thirty-two, at which time I was well-known as a physician. What I then earned from practising medicine was not only sufficient but left me a surplus that has lasted even until the present day, when I am at the end of my fifty-ninth year. With the revenues left after my expenses, I have acquired properties in this city [Cairo] which – if God decrees that they remain secure and allows me to attain old age – will yield enough to enable me to subsist.

                                    for myself, amending it every year up to this present account as I approach my sixtieth year. My daily exertion in my profession is sufficient exercise for me to maintain the health of my body. After that exertion, I rest, and then eat food selected for the preservation of my health. In my conduct, I do my best to be modest, considerate to others, helpful to the dejected, alert to the anxieties of the unfortunate, and of help to the poor. I make it my purpose in all this to enjoy the satisfaction that comes from good deeds and thoughtful sentiments. But it is essential as well that this brings monetary profit from which I can earn a living. I spend money on the health of my body and the maintenance of my household, neither squandering money nor being stingy. Rather, I keep to the path of moderation, as is prudent at any time. I inspect the furnishings of my household and whatever is in need of repair, I repair, and whatever is in need of replacement, I replace. In addition, I am responsible for what is required in terms of food, honey, olive oil and firewood, as well as clothing. Whatever remains after my expenses, I spend on various good purposes such as donations to family, associates, neighbours, and maintenance of the household. Accumulated revenue from my properties I set aside for their maintenance and further investment in them, and for times of need. When contemplating a new enterprise in commerce, building or something else, I assign the matter great importance and, if the project seems likely to be successful, I promptly allocate the appropriate amount, but if it seems unlikely to be successful, I reject it. I inform myself as much as I can regarding worthy enterprises and make the necessary arrangements.

                                    I make certain my clothes are decorated with marks of distinction and are clean. I also use a pleasant perfume. I am quiet and hold my tongue regarding people’s failings. I try not to speak except when appropriate and take care to avoid swearing and criticizing others’ opinions. I avoid pridefulness and love of superiority. I reject worries of greed and dejection.

                                    If adversity befalls me, I rely on God, exalted be He, and face it reasonably, without cowardice or rashness.

If someone requests a loan from me, I give it to him, but I do not refuse it if he repays it.

Ibn Riḍwān would have been 29 years old when the caliph al-Ḥākim died and 44 years old when the caliph al-Mustanṣir came to rule, so either is technically possible; if al-Mustanṣir were intended, then Ibn Riḍwān would have had twenty-five years in which he might have served him, while the period of service to al-Ḥākim would have been considerably less.

The reason for this change occurred during the period of the famine when he adopted an orphan-girl whom he raised in his house. One day he left her by herself in the house where he had accumulated valuables and gold worth about 20,000 dinars. She took all of it and fled. She was never heard from again, and Ibn Riḍwān was not successful in finding out where she had gone. From then on, his mental faculties deteriorated.</p>

                            I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say that Ibn Riḍwān was often inclined to polemics against his contemporaries, both physicians and others, and many of his predecessors as well. He was insolent in his discussion and slandered those who wanted to dispute him. Much of this is evident in his refutations of Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq,

                            On this issue he composed a book in which he argues that learning medicine from books is more satisfactory than learning it from teachers. Ibn Buṭlān refutes this and other opinions of Ibn Riḍwān’s in a monograph. In one chapter of this book Ibn Buṭlān lays out the reasons why learning from personal instruction is preferable to instruction through the written word, assuming that both possess the same learning ability. Ibn Buṭlān presents a number of reasons:

                                ‘like’ – that is to say, the teacher – is better understood by the student through speech, while the ‘dissimilar’ – that is, the book – is inanimate. The distance of the inanimate from the animate lengthens the path of understanding, while the closeness of the speaking person to another speaker makes the path to understanding shorter. Therefore, learning from something similar – that is, the teacher – is shorter and easier than from something dissimilar – that is, the book.

                                The reception of knowledge in the learner’s soul is called ‘learning something’, and the two correlated things – [teaching and learning] – go together naturally.

                                : when the student finds unintelligible what the teacher is trying to make him understand, the teacher can recast his explanation in different words, whereas a book cannot rephrase a statement. It follows that comprehension from a teacher is more successful for a student than comprehension from a book, and whenever it is conducted in this manner, the transmission of knowledge is more successful for the student.

                                : the basis of learning is verbal expression, and verbal expression is of three types: (1) That which is closely associated with the intellect – which is to say, that which is formed by the mind as a model for the meaning that is in it. (2) The intermediate – which is verbal expression vocalized – is a model for what is formed by the mind. (3) The distant – which is set down in books – is a model for what is produced through verbal expression. A book is therefore a model of a model of a model of the meaning that was in the mind. The first model cannot take the place of that which was modelled, because of the inadequacy of the comparison – so what are we to think of a model twice removed? The first model, belonging to the mind, is closer in terms of understanding than the model of the model [once removed]. The first model is verbal expression, the second is the book. This being the case, understanding based on the verbal expression of the teacher is easier and more immediate than the verbal expression of a book.

                                : the transmission of verbal expression signifying meaning to the mind may occur by way of a sense perception that is alien to verbal expression – that is, vision. Something transmitted through what is ‘similar’ or ‘like’ – in this case, verbal expression – is more immediate than its transmission through what is alien – that is, writing. Accordingly, understanding from a teacher by means of verbal expression is easier and more accessible than understanding gained from the written words of a book.

                                    had not heard it explained by Aristotle himself, it would not have been understood from the book alone. Since this is the case, it is clear that learning from a teacher is better than learning from the written word.

                            The death of ʿAlī ibn Riḍwān, may God have mercy upon him, was in the year 453/1061 in Egypt during the caliphate of al-Mustanṣir bi-Allāh Abū Tamīm Maʿadd ibn al-Ẓāhir li-Iʿzāz al-Dīn al-Ḥākim.

                            ) through which his body is kept in good health and for which people praise him and with which he earns a sufficient amount, it is best for him to spend the remainder of each day devoted to submission to God. And the best form of submission is the contemplation of the kingdom of God (

                                    ) of the parts of the body: the appearance (

                                    ), the temperament, and the feel of the skin. Then investigate the functioning of the internal and external parts by, for example, calling to the patient from afar so as to learn from his reaction the state of his hearing. Or, evaluate his vision by having him look at distant objects and ones that are close by. Similarly, evaluate his tongue by his articulation and his strength (

                                    ) by having him lift weights, grasp and hold [something], and walk. Similarly, to take another example, by observing a patient’s manner of walking from the front and from the back and ordering him to lie down on his back with his arms extended and then having him raise his legs with them held together, you can evaluate the general condition of his intestines (

                                    ). You can also determine the condition of the temperament (

                                    ) of his heart by means of the pulse and the disposition of his character (

[Only] at that point should you treat it. Identifying the disease means you must first determine from which humour it has arisen and then, after that, the part of the body in which it is located. At that point, you may treat it.</item>

Ifrāʾīm ibn al-Zaffān was keenly interested in acquiring books and having books copied, so much so that eventually he came to possess a large collection of books on medicine and other topics. He always had copyists in his employ, whom he paid well. One of these was Muḥammad ibn Saʿīd ibn Hishām al-Ḥajarī, known as Ibn Mulsāqah. I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – have found a number of books in the latter’s handwriting that he had transcribed for Ifrāʾīm, with some of Ifrāʾīm’s own handwriting on them as well.

He met with Ifrāʾīm and they agreed that Ifrāʾīm would sell him 10,000 volumes from the books in his possession. This was in the days of the governorship of al-Afḍal ibn Amīr al-Juyūsh.

                            When al-Afḍal heard of this [transaction] he determined that those books should remain in Egypt and not removed elsewhere [and taken out of the country]. So he sent to Ifrāʾīm out of his own resources the entire price that had been agreed between Ifrāʾīm and the Iraqi, and the books were transferred to al-Afḍal’s library, and his honorific titles were inscribed in them. This is why I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – have come across a great number of medical books, as well as volumes on other topics, bearing the name of Ifrāʾīm as well as the honorific titles of al-Afḍal.

He writes at the beginning of the compendium what the purpose of it is: ‘I say that I, Ifrāʾīm, have composed this book to be a memorandum book in the form of a collection of items rather than a formal composition, as a warning against negligence for anyone who is treating diseases’.

                                        Ibn Ḥamdān was a military leader under the eighth Fatimid caliph, al-Mustanṣir (r. 427–487/1036–1094), descended from the Hamdanids of Mosul in Iraq. He led the Turkish and Berber troops to defeat Arab uprisings in the Delta in Egypt but eventually turned on al-Mustanṣir and took control of Cairo for a period, taking the title of Sulṭān al-Dawlah. He and his family were eventually killed by a rival Turkish military faction.

                            Abū l-Khayr Salāmah ibn Mubārak ibn Raḥmūn ibn Mūsā was a Jewish physician who was one of the distinguished citizens of Egypt. He was known not only for his excellent achievements in the art of medicine, but also for his knowledge of the writings of Galen and his investigation of their obscure passages. He had studied the art of medicine under Ifrāʾīm [ibn al-Zaffān]

Ibn Raḥmūn was also an outstanding scholar in the domains of logic and the philosophical disciplines, and composed a number of works in those fields. The teacher under whom he studied was the emir Abū l-Wafāʾ Maḥmūd al-Dawlah al-Mubashshir ibn Fātik.

He was acquainted with Abū l-Wafāʾ al-Mubashshir ibn Fātik and learned from him something of the art of logic, in which he became particularly distinguished. He was also associated with Abū Kathīr ibn al-Zaffān,

Subsequently, he endeavoured to teach all the works on logic, natural philosophy and metaphysics, but he explained them as he saw fit, interpreting and summarizing them with no evidence of having studied, grasped or investigated the finer points of knowledge. Rather, he talked excessively and so committed errors; his answers were hurried and frequently erroneous. Upon my first encounter with him, I asked him about issues that had arisen in the course of his discussion – things that could be understood even by one who did not have any great breadth of knowledge in the field. He answered in a way that exposed his shortcomings, articulated his incompetence, and made clear his lack of imagination and understanding. In his great pretensions and his incompetence at even the easiest of his undertakings, he can be compared to the man described by the poet:

                                    There was in Cairo a physician from Antioch called Jirjis, who was nicknamed ‘The Philosopher’ in the way you might call a raven Abū l-Bayḍāʾ (‘whitey’),

Then he would see to it that they were placed in the hands of someone who would ask him about their meaning and request an explanation of their purposes, whereupon he would discourse at length about them and explain them just anyhow, without caution or care, but rather with abandon, haste, indifference to content, and intrigue. Some amusing compositions by him are extant.

                                    Presumably these terms were used because it was thought that carbuncles (or pustules, for

Another explanation of the title is that carbuncles and pustules were sometimes cured by opening them with the edge of a potsherd. Sami Hamarneh argues that this treatise should actually be ascribed to Ibn al-ʿAynzarbī (see Ch. 14.29 for his biography) based on a copy of this work that was found housed at the Ẓāhiriyyah Library of Damascus in which an introductory statement of the manuscript ascribes authorship to Ibn al-ʿAynzarbī. Hamarneh also argues that the style of the treatise is the same as other compositions by Ibn al-ʿAynzarbI; see Hamarneh, ‘Ibn al-ʿAyn Zarbi and his Definition of Diseases’.

                        <p>At the beginning of his career, however, Ibn al-ʿAynzarbī had earned his living exclusively from astrology. I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – had the following account from my father:</p>

                            <quote>
                                <p>A grandson of the shaykh Abū Naṣr ʿAdnān ibn al-ʿAynzarbī informed me that the fame of his grandfather in Egypt and his connection with the caliphs was due to the arrival there of an envoy [to the court] from Baghdad who had known Ibn al-ʿAynzarbī previously and was familiar with his reputation for excellence and proficiency in many fields of learning. While walking along one of the streets of Cairo, he suddenly came upon Ibn al-ʿAynzarbī sitting there earning his living as an astrologer, and he recognized him and greeted him. The envoy was astonished that, despite his great learning and pre-eminent status in the art of medicine, Ibn al-ʿAynzarbī should be in such a lowly condition. This [encounter] remained in his mind, so that when he met with the vizier and was engaged in conversation with him, he mentioned Ibn al-ʿAynzarbī and his reputation for learning and for superiority and pre-eminence in medicine as well as other fields. The envoy remarked on this, adding that people did not know his value and that he should not be neglected. This made the vizier eager to see Ibn al-ʿAynzarbī and to meet him first hand, so he sent for him and, upon listening to him, was greatly impressed by what he had said. The vizier became convinced of Ibn al-ʿAynzarbī’s excellence and his eminent position in the world of learning. Consequently, he informed the caliph of his situation, whereupon the caliph dispatched to Ibn al-ʿAynzarbī a present befitting someone of his stature. From that time onward, favours and gifts flowed to him in a steady stream.</p>

                            I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say: Ibn al-ʿAynzarbī was well-versed and knowledgeable in Arabic and had excellent penmanship. I have seen a number of books on medicine and other subjects in his handwriting, which is of the utmost beauty and high quality and adheres to the proportional method.

                            Bulmuẓaffar had good penmanship and an excellent turn of phrase. He was especially interested in the art of alchemy, studying it and meeting with its adherents. With his own hand, he copied a very large number of books on that subject as well as numerous medical and philosophical works. He was keenly interested in acquiring books and reading them.

                                    This Sadīd al-Dīn is probably to be identified with Sadīd al-Dīn ibn Raqīqah, a colleague of

                            has related to me – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – that in Bulmuẓaffar’s house there was a large sitting room with shelves that were laden with books, and that Bulmuẓaffar spent most of his time in that room occupied with writing, reading and copying.

                            I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say that one marvellous detail concerning him is that, while he owned many thousands of books of all kinds, there was not one that did not have inscribed on its cover some witticisms and anecdotes relating to whatever topic formed the subject of the book. I myself have seen a great many books on medicine and other subjects that were among the philosophical books formerly belonging to Bulmuẓaffar,

His honorific name was Sharaf al-Dīn, but the nickname of his father, Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī, came to be applied to him, so that he was known as al-Shaykh al-Sadīd (‘The Well-Guided Shaykh’). Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd Abū l-Manṣūr ʿAbd Allāh was knowledgeable in the art of medicine and experienced in its fundamentals as well as its details. He excelled in therapeutics, had a great deal of practical experience and was skilful in surgical procedures (

He had a long life during which he was considered to be amongst the medical elite (

He came to the throne as a child, proclaimed caliph by the vizier, al-Afḍal, who held power for most of the caliph’s reign. Al-Āmir was assassinated by Nizārī supporters in 524/1130. See

                                    That was because my father was a physician in his service and had influence over him, holding a prominent position during his reign. I was a youth at that time and my father used to give me a few dirhams each day to sit at the door of our house and perform bloodletting on chance clients until I became experienced and acquired great skill in that operation. I also learned something of the medical art, so that one day my father mentioned me to the caliph al-Āmir and told him about me, explaining that I knew the art of bloodletting and was very skilful at it. The caliph then sent for me, and I went to him, dressed in splendid clothes and riding a spirited mount adorned with a gold collar and similar trappings. When I entered the palace, accompanied by my father, and came before the caliph, I kissed the ground and paid homage to him. He then said to me, ‘Bleed this gentleman (

He had veins that stood out clearly, and so I bled him and bandaged the place of the incision. The caliph said to me, ‘You did well,’ and ordered a well-filled purse and splendid robes of honour to be presented to me. From that time on, I went repeatedly to the palace in attendance on the caliph, who bestowed on me payment that was quite sufficient and more than I could have wished for, as well as frequent gratuities and numerous presents.

Ibn al-Naqqāsh [then] heard about Egypt and the favours of the caliphs there and their generosity and kindness to those who approached them, especially those endowed with learning and refinement. Accordingly, he decided he must travel there. Upon reaching Egypt, having heard of al-Shaykh al-Sadīd, the physician of the caliphs, and his merits, the extent of his wealth, his good character, and his notable virtuousness (

                                    ), he determined to call on him. After waiting for a few days, Ibn al-Naqqāsh went to al-Shaykh al-Sadīd’s house, where he greeted the physician, informed him of his occupation and explained that he had come with the purpose of seeking him out and entrusting all his affairs to him and absorbing some of his sea of knowledge. Ibn al-Naqqāsh acknowledged that whatever he might receive from the caliphs would be due to al-Shaykh al-Sadīd’s kindness and that he would credit him with that all the rest of this life. Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd received him in an appropriate manner and honoured him greatly.

                                    Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd then said to him, ‘What would you consider sufficient pay for you if you were to stay in Cairo?’ ‘My lord,’ Ibn al-Naqqāsh replied, ‘whatever you think and whatever you command would be sufficient for me.’ ‘State a specific figure,’ said al-Shaykh al-Sadīd, to which Ibn al-Naqqāsh replied, ‘By God, if I were granted a monthly stipend of ten Egyptian dinars, I would consider that a generous amount.’ ‘No,’ replied al-Shaykh al-Sadīd, ‘that would not be adequate for your upkeep. I will instruct my agent to arrange for you to have fifteen Egyptian dinars every month, an apartment near me – with all its furnishings and carpets (

Then al-Shaykh al-Sadīd said:

                            Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd never ceased to enjoy the respect of the caliphs. His influence and esteem amongst them increased steadily from the time of al-Āmir bi-Aḥkām Allāh to the last days of al-ʿĀḍid bi-Allāh.

But then he went to Syria, where Saladin consulted him on medical matters and followed his prescriptions and advice more frequently than those of other physicians. Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd continued as chief of the physicians up to the time of his death.

Toward the end of his life a catastrophe befell him: that house of his was consumed by fire, and his furniture, household implements, belongings and many other things in the house were lost. When part of the house collapsed from the fire, a number of large clay vessels and jars filled with Egyptian gold coins fell and broke open. Between the fire and the general destruction of the house, the gold was scattered in all directions. Bystanders witnessed some of the gold pieces melting from the fire, with the loss of many thousands of them.

He was secretly worried by that dream, and so he decided to move from there and began to build a house near the old one, urging the builders to finish as soon as possible. When it was complete, save but one room, and he could move into it, his [old] house in which he had been living caught fire. That was on the twenty-sixth of Jumādā

Ibn Jumayʿ was versatile, being learned in many disciplines. He worked hard at the art of medicine, becoming skilled at treatment and composing works on the subject. He studied for a time under the tutelage of al-shaykh al-Muwaffaq Abū Naṣr ʿAdnān ibn al-ʿAynzarbī.

                            Ibn Jumayʿ was born and raised in Fustat (Old Cairo). He served al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb (Saladin), enjoying the ruler’s favour and holding an influential position of the highest level during his reign. It was for Saladin, who consulted him in medical matters, that Ibn Jumayʿ compounded the great theriac known as

In the course of our conversation, Ibn Maṭrūḥ said to me graciously, ‘No one before you has ever composed the like of your book on the classes of physicians.’ Then he asked, ‘Did you include our fellow Egyptian physicians?’ ‘Yes,’ I replied. ‘I am of the impression,’ he said, ‘that you stated that none of the earlier Egyptian physicians surpassed Ibn Riḍwān, and that of the later physicians, there was none who surpassed Ibn Jumayʿ.’ ‘That is correct, my lord,’ I replied.

                                    a funeral procession passed by him. When he saw the procession, he called out to the mourners, telling them that their beloved was not dead and that if they interred him, they would be burying him alive. They stood looking at him in surprise at his words, unable to believe what he had said. Then one of them said to another, ‘What harm will it do us to test what he says. If it is true, it is what we want. If it is not true, it makes no difference to us.’ They summoned him over and said, ‘Prove what you just said to us.’ Ibn Jumayʿ instructed them to return home and remove the shroud from the deceased. There he said to them, ‘Carry him to the bath house.’ He then poured hot water on the body to warm it up, bathed it with warm compresses and immersed it in water until a small amount of sensation was perceptible and the man moved slightly. ‘Rejoice at his return to life!’ cried Ibn Jumayʿ. He then continued treating the person until he regained consciousness and felt well. This was the beginning of Ibn Jumayʿ’s fame for excellence and knowledge in the medical art, for it seemed that he had performed a miracle. Afterward, he was asked how he had known that the body being carried covered in shrouds was still alive. ‘I looked at his feet,’ he replied, ‘and saw that they were upright. The feet of those who have died are splayed out. So I surmised that he was alive, and my guess was correct.’

He served the Egyptian caliphs in the final years of their reign, and subsequently he served al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn (that is, Saladin), who used to consult him, depended on him for treatment and had a good opinion of him. Abū l-Bayān received from Saladin a generous salary and great consideration.

                        <p>The shaykh Abū l-Bayān ibn al-Mudawwar was long-lived. Toward the end of his life he became inactive due to old age and weak from [years of] great activity and frequent service. Accordingly, al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn, may God have mercy upon him, granted him a stipend of twenty-four Egyptian dinars a month so that he could stay home and not be troubled with the burden of service. Abū l-Bayān lived in that fashion, drawing his pension, for about twenty years. But during that period of withdrawal to his house, he did not forego his occupation with medicine, nor was his residence empty of students or persons practising under his direction or coming to consult him. During that period, he did not leave [the house] to treat anyone except those who were very dear to him.</p>

The clan itself played a significant role in the political affairs of Syria and Egypt under the Ayyubids. Al-Mubārak ibn Kāmil became a part of the administrative system of Saladin’s government in Egypt and then participated in a military expedition to Yemen where he became governor of Zabīd for a time.

                            My father has related to me – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – that a Jewish friend of Abū l-Faḍāʾil ibn al-Nāqid once came to him in dire straits and asked Abū l-Faḍāʾil to help him. Abū l-Faḍāʾil had him sit in his house, and said to him, ‘My earnings today will be yours as your good fortune and blessing from God.’ Then he rode off and went to visit the ill and those whom he was treating for eye diseases. When he returned, he took out his oculist’s bag (

He was well-known under the ruling dynasty, being described as excellent and much praised for his methods of treatment. He lived in Old Cairo (Fustat). Some of his children converted to Islam.

Thereafter, he served Saladin’s brother al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr ibn Ayyūb.

Sultan al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn (Saladin) became aware of him and sought his medical advice, as did Saladin’s son, al-Malik al-Afḍal ʿAlī.

                        <p>Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd ibn Abī-l-Bayān – that is, Sadīd al-Dīn Abū l-Faḍl Dāwūd ibn Abī l-Bayān Sulaymān ibn Abī l-Faraj Isrāʾīl ibn Abī l-Ṭayyib Sulaymān ibn Mubārak – was a Karaite Israelite born in Cairo in the year 556/1160. He was a recognized master of the medical art, in which he was proficient, having been distinguished in both theory and practice and experienced with simple and compound remedies. Whenever we treated the patients at the Nāṣirī hospital in Cairo, I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – witnessed the excellence of his achievements with regard to the knowledge and identification of diseases, the recollection of appropriate therapies, and his acquaintance with what Galen had said concerning them – all of which defies description.</p>
                        <p>
                            Among the physicians of his time, Ibn Abī l-Bayān was the most capable in compounding drugs and knowing the appropriate quantities and weights. So much so that when patients with various illnesses, even rare ones, came to consult him, he would dictate on the spot, in accordance with just what that patient required, medical prescriptions for compound drugs such as pastilles (
                            <hi rend="italic">al-aqrāṣ</hi>
                            ), medicinal powders (

                            ) and so forth. These prescriptions were of the utmost quality and very well designed.

He made a good collection [of material] and went to great lengths in its composition, limiting himself to the compound drugs generally used in the hospitals and pharmacies of Egypt, Syria and Iraq. I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – read it under his guidance and corrected my copy with his help.

The manuscript employed by Sbath (dated 874/1469 and in his own collection) was reproduced photographically and prefaced with a Castilian translation in José Luis Valverde and Carmen Peña Muñoz (Ibn Abī l-Bayān,

He mastered the medical art, distinguishing himself in its two areas of theory and practice. In addition, he was much occupied with belles-lettres (

                            Ibn Abī l-Ḥawāfir – may God have mercy upon him – was a man of great virtue, well-versed in classical Arabic, recognized for his achievements and characterized by a good disposition. In his beneficence, he gave generously to the elite and the common people alike and bestowed many favors upon them. Born and raised in Damascus, he studied the art of medicine under the Imām Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ibn al-Naqqāsh

                                    One day, when Ibn Abī l-Ḥawāfir was out riding in a neighbourhood of Cairo, he saw a vendor of boiled chickpeas sitting on a stone bench while a Jewish oculist was standing in front of him. In the oculist’s hand was a container of eye medicines (

In addition, the author may well have been referencing the first aphorism of Hippocrates (‘Life is short, the Art long, …’), which was known to virtually all well-educated people of his day.

                                    arrested in Jerusalem, and he became ill while in custody. So, King Amalric sent him [Abū Saʿīd, who had been left in charge after Abū Sulaymān left] to treat him. When he arrived, he found his patient in a pit fettered with irons. Abū Saʿīd returned to the King and said to him, ‘This man was accustomed to a life of ease. Now, even if you gave him the elixir of life, it would not benefit him in his present condition.’ ‘What shall I do with him?’ asked the King. Abū Saʿīd replied, ‘The King should release him from the pit, have his fetters removed and be magnanimous, for he needs no other therapy than that’. To this, King Amalric answered, ‘We are afraid that he will flee, for he owes a large amount of tax.’ ‘Release him into my custody,’ said Abū Saʿīd to the King, ‘and he shall be my responsibility.’ ‘Take him,’ answered the King, ‘and when his tax debt is paid, you shall have one thousand dinars out of it.’

                                    Abū Saʿīd left and took ʿĪsā out of the pit, removed his fetters, and made a place for him in his own house, where he remained for six months, and during that time Abū Saʿīd took complete care of him. When the taxes had been paid, the King requested the presence of the

                                    Abū Saʿīd along with the aforementioned jurist, ʿĪsā, so they went together. They found the money in bags in front of the King, and he gave him [Abū Sāʿīd] one of the bags, as he had promised. Abū Saʿīd took it and said to the King, ‘My lord, these one thousand dinars which have come to me, may I have the right to dispose of them as owners do with their own property?’ King Amalric agreed, and so Abū Saʿīd, there in the King’s presence, gave the money to the jurist ʿĪsā, saying to him: ‘I know that the payment of these taxes has left you with nothing, and perhaps you may even have had to take a loan to pay it. So, accept these thousand dinars from me as help for your travel expenses.’ ʿĪsā accepted the dinars from him and then set off to rejoin Saladin.

                            Abū Sulaymān Dāwūd learned through astrological readings that Saladin would conquer Jerusalem on a certain day of a certain month in a certain year and that he would enter the city through the Raḥmah Gate.

                            Unlike his four brothers, who were physicians, Abū l-Khayr had become a soldier, and Abū Sulaymān told him to go as his messenger to Saladin and to report the good news to him [that he would be] King of Jerusalem at the designated time. Obedient to his father’s order, Abū l-Khayr set out on his way to Saladin’s court, arriving there on the first day

                            of the year 580 [14 April 1184], and the people were busy celebrating the new year. So Abū l-Khayr went directly to the aforementioned jurist, ʿĪsā, who was very pleased to see him. They went together to call on Saladin, and Abū l-Khayr delivered the message from his father. The sultan was very pleased indeed and bestowed upon him a splendid reward. Then he gave Abū l’Khayr a yellow banner and an arrow of the same colour. ‘When God enables me to do what you have said, place this yellow banner and arrow above your house,’ he said, ‘and the quarter in which you live will be completely safe because of the protection given your house.’

Then he wrote a decree valid throughout the entire realm, both land and sea, exempting them [Abū Sulaymān’s family] from all the obligations imposed upon Christians, and they have been free from them to this day.

                            Abū Sulaymān died shortly after the following occurrence: Saladin summoned him, rose, stood before him, and said: ‘You are a blessed shaykh. Your good tidings reached us, and everything you predicted has happened. So you may ask me for something [as a reward].’ ‘I ask that you protect my sons,’ said Abū Sulaymān. So, Saladin looked after his sons and took care of them. Subsequently he entrusted them to his own son [and successor] al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, instructing him to be generous to them and to make them part of his retinue and that of his sons. And so it was done.

He took them, and when al-Malik al-Kāmil came out from the bath, he presented the gifts to him. Al-Malik al-Kāmil accepted them and went into the storerooms, where he emptied the plates of fruit, filled them with bolts of lustrous fabric, and sent his servant with the tray to Abū Ḥulayqah’s father. Al-Malik al-Kāmil then took Abū Ḥulayqah (who was at that time about eight years old) by the hand and escorted him to al-Malik al-ʿĀdil.

He was the eldest son of the then Ayyubid ruler of Syria (including Diyārbakr) and Egypt, al-Malik al-ʿĀdil I Sayf al-Dīn, and at this time served as his father’s representative.

Then al-Malik al-ʿĀdil turned to the boy’s father, al-Fāris, who was standing there waiting along with the other attendants, and said to him:

                            who fell ill. It was the sultan’s regular practice not to allow any other physician to work with Abū Ḥulayqah when he was treating him or any of the cherished women and children of the royal household. In this instance, Abū Ḥulayqah had been treating the aforementioned ailing woman for a few days when some urgent business called him away from the patient and he went to Cairo where he remained for eighteen days. When he returned to al-ʿAbbāsiyyah, he found that the other court physicians were treating the sick woman. When he appeared and talked with them, they said to him, ‘This woman is going to die, and it is imperative that we inform the sultan of this, so that her death does not come as a surprise to him.’ But Abū Ḥulayqah said to them, ‘In my opinion, this woman does not have a fatal illness but rather will recover, God willing.’ One of the physicians, who was the most senior of them in age, said to the young Abū Ḥulayqah, ‘Indeed I am older than you are, and I have treated more patients than you have, so you should agree with me on the writing of this message [to the sultan]’. But Abū Ḥulayqah did not agree to it. When the entire group of the physicians told him that they absolutely had to send the message, Abū Ḥulayqah said to them, ‘If you must send this message, it will be with your names but without mine.’

                            So, the physicians wrote to the sultan about the woman’s impending death. The sultan dispatched a messenger, accompanied by a carpenter who was to make a coffin for her. When the messenger arrived with the carpenter at the gate and the physicians were sitting nearby, Abū Ḥulayqah asked the messenger, ‘What is this carpenter doing here?’ ‘He is going to make a coffin for your patient,’ the messenger replied. ‘You would put her into it while she is still alive?’ said Abū Ḥulayqah. ‘No,’ said the messenger, ‘but after her death.’ ‘Return to the sultan with this coffin,’ said Abū Ḥulayqah, ‘and tell him from me that she is not going to die.’ So the messenger went back and informed the sultan of what Abū Ḥulayqah had said. When night fell, a servant from the sultan arrived, bearing a candle and a piece of paper on which the words ‘The son of al-Fāris is to appear before us’ were written in the sultan’s handwriting. – He was not yet called Abū Ḥulayqah, for that was not his name until after the sultan al-Malik al-Kāmil made a remark one day, when the future Abū Ḥulayqah was sitting with physicians at the gate and the sultan ordered his servant to look for the physician. The servant asked him, ‘My lord,

I cannot sleep at night, and I cannot rest during the day.’ ‘My lord,’ said Abū Ḥulayqah, ‘Rub your teeth with the theriac that the servant has brought in that small silver vessel, and you will see, God willing, a most amazing thing.’ Abū Ḥulayqah departed toward the gate, but hardly had he gone out when a message in the sultan’s handwriting was brought to him. ‘O

He did not intend to use it in order to obtain favours from a king or to seek money or glory in the world. Rather, he intended to seek closeness to God by aiding all of His creatures and showing compassion to all creation. He gave it freely to the sick, and with it he relieved the partially paralyzed and straightened crooked hands immediately and quickly, for it would produce in the nerves (

                        <p>One day, Abū Ḥulayqah passed by the doorman of a gate that was situated between the two walls of Cairo, may God protect it. The doorman was a man known as ʿAlī, and he lay on his back, unable to move from one side to the other. This man complained of his condition to Abū Ḥulayqah, who gave him a dose of the theriac and then went on his way, ascending to the citadel to attend to the infirm there. When the physician returned the following morning, the doorman who had been paralyzed was standing on his legs, calling to him. ‘Sit down,’ said Abū Ḥulayqah, but the doorman replied, ‘By God, I am fed up with sitting, let me enjoy myself.’</p>

This caused him intense suffering, to the point that he was on the verge of death. He wrote to al-Malik al-Kāmil informing him of his condition and requesting authorization to go home to be treated. When he arrived at his house all the great physicians of the day were summoned, and each of them prescribed something for him, but nothing was of any benefit. But then he sent for the

                            Abū Ḥulayqah, who gave him a dose of his theriac. In the amount of time it took for it to reach his stomach, its potency penetrated to the place of the stone and broke it up so that it came out when he urinated, stained from the colouring of the medication. The patient recovered immediately, returned to his service with the sultan, and called for the noon prayer. At that time, the sultan was encamped at Giza,

                            in Cairo, and when he heard the muezzin’s voice he ordered him brought to him. When Jaʿfar arrived, al-Malik al-Kāmil said to him, ‘What about the letter that you sent to me yesterday, in which you said you were near death? Explain to me what has happened!’ ‘My lord,’ said the muezzin, ‘it would have been so had it not been for my lord’s physician, Abū Ḥulayqah, who gave me a theriac that cured me immediately.’

                        <p>‘My lord’, said Abū Ḥulayqah, ‘your humble servant does nothing but for your lordship. The reason for the delay in informing you was so that your humble servant might test the theriac, since it was he who had developed it, and if the testing were to work out well, he would bring it to my lord’s notice. But since the theriac’s effectiveness is now known to my lord, that aim has been achieved.’</p>

                        <p>Abū Ḥulayqah went to his house, but could only find a meagre amount of the theriac because the people had almost exhausted his supply of it with their demand for it. So he went to his colleagues, to whom he had given some of it, and gathered a quantity of eleven dirhams from them, promising them that he would give them double compensation for it. He put the theriac in a small silver vessel on which he wrote the uses and dosages and took it to the aforementioned servant who was sitting waiting for him. The servant carried the vessel to the sultan, who kept the theriac secure in the vessel, so that when his teeth were hurting, he could rub some of it on them and in that way obtain relief.</p>

You do not come to treat me, not because you lack the knowledge but because of indifference toward my personal state. The proof of your skill is that if you became ill, you would treat yourself in a few days, and, likewise, if one of your children were to become ill, you would cure the child within a couple of days as well. The same goes for the other women here, for you treat them and your treatment is always effective after a short period.</p>

                            The sultan engaged two Christian physicians for her. They arrived from Damascus to treat her just as the sultan was about to travel to Damietta.

                            The physicians asked which of them would go with the sultan and which would stay behind. ‘All of the physicians will remain to care for the woman,’ said al-Malik al-Kāmil, ‘except Abū Ḥulayqah, for he shall be the only one to come with me.’ Since the physicians had done all they could for the woman and had become weary of treating her to no purpose, it [travelling with the sultan] was a convenient excuse for Abū Ḥulayqah. He quoted what Hippocrates says about prognosis.

                            So Abū Ḥulayqah travelled to Damietta with al-Malik al-Kāmil as his personal physician, but for a month the sultan did not request his services. Then one night the sultan sent for him, and when Abū Ḥulayqah came before his master, he found the sultan feverish and displaying various contradictory symptoms. So the physician compounded a potion (
                            <hi rend="italic">mashrūb</hi>
                            ) that was suitable for these various symptoms and brought it to the sultan at dawn, and the Sun had not set but what all his suffering ceased. That was very much to his liking, and the sultan continued to follow that regimen until he arrived in Alexandria.

                        <p>It happened that on the first day of the fasting in the month of Ramadan Abū Ḥulayqah became ill. The physicians who were in the sultan’s service came to him and sought his advice on what they should bring to the sultan for his fast-breaking meal that evening. ‘He has a potion that he praises highly, has been using regularly, and always requests,’ replied Abū Ḥulayqah. ‘As long as he does not complain of anything new that would make it unwise for him to take it, give it to him. If some new symptom becomes apparent to you, use your judgment and prescribe accordingly.’</p>

                            But the other physicians did not follow his instructions and deliberately changed the sultan’s regime. This altered the sultan’s temperament for the worse. He sent for the physicians and requested Abū Ḥulayqah’s potion, interrogating them about it. The formula for the compound had included endive seeds,

                            which they had removed. ‘Why did you omit this seed?’ asked the sultan, ‘for endive seed is a restorative for the liver, cleans the blood vessels and prevents thirst?’ One of the physicians present said, ‘By God, your servants are not to be blamed for the omission. It is only that al-Asʿad ibn Abī l-Ḥasan has related a curious tradition according to which endive seed is harmful to the spleen. But your humble servant, (I swear) by God, doesn’t know! And al-Asʿad maintains that your lordship has an inflammation of the spleen (

He then took the drink again as before, finding it always beneficial and praiseworthy.

One day, when the sultan was about to travel to Asia Minor (Bilād al-Rūm), he asked Abū Ḥulayqah, ‘Will this sauce keep for a long time?’ ‘No,’ replied Abū Ḥulayqah. ‘Does it last even a month?’ enquired the sultan. ‘Yes,’ Abū Ḥulayqah answered, ‘if it is prepared in the way I indicated.’ ‘Every month make me a quantity sufficient to last the month,’ said the sultan, ‘and send it to me at the beginning of every (lunar) month.’ Abū Ḥulayqah produced some of the sauce each month, sending it to him along the difficult mountain passes

                            Yet another anecdote about Abū Ḥulayqah is the following: A woman from the countryside came to him with her son, who was an emaciated, sickly youth. She complained of her son’s condition and said that, although she had tried hard to treat him, he had only become thinner and weaker. The woman had come to Abū Ḥulayqah in the morning before he rode out on his rounds, so it was still cold. The physician looked at the youth, enquired about his condition, and felt the young man’s pulse. While doing so he said to his servant, ‘Go and bring me my

After a little time had passed, he felt the youth’s pulse, and found that it had calmed down. But when the servant came to him and said, ‘Here is your
                            <hi rend="italic">farajiyyah</hi>

                            I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say that this story is similar to one attributed to Galen with regard to a woman in love. He had been called to the house of a woman of high rank who had been ill for a long time. He surmised that she was in love and visited her frequently. One day, he was feeling her pulse while soldiers were carrying out exercises in the square. Someone present was relating what they were doing and that so-and-so was displaying good horsemanship and excellent athletic ability. When the woman heard the name of the man, her pulse changed. Galen felt it some time later and found that it had settled back to its previous rate. Then Galen secretly told the person to repeat his report. When he repeated it, Galen again felt the woman’s pulse and found it had quickened, so he diagnosed that she was in love with the man being described. This anecdote indicates an abundance of knowledge and great insight in prognostics.

When I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – met the scholar Rashīd al-Dīn Abū Ḥulayqah, he had heard that I had mentioned the well-known physicians of his family and described their learning and achievements.

When his mother was pregnant with him, his father was advised to have made a silver ring and to give the value of its silver as alms. Al-Fāris had arranged to have a jeweller present at the hour in which his child was born, in order to pierce the infant’s ear and put the silver ring in it. He did so, and God gave the boy life. His mother made a pact with her son (Abū Ḥulayqah, ‘the one with the ring’) that he was not to remove the ring, and so it remained. In due course Abū Ḥulayqah married and had a number of male children who died, as had happened in his own family. Then he thought of the ring and had one made for his eldest son, who was known as Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Abū Saʿīd,

In this treatise, in the explanation (of this inevitability) the author says that since the human being continues to disintegrate due to the inner heat of its body and the heat from the atmosphere which is outside, it is eventually destroyed by these two factors. Abū Ḥulayqah illustrates this by quoting this verse:

Born in Cairo in the year 620/1223, he was named Muḥammad when he became a Muslim during the reign of al-Malik al-Ẓāhir Rukn al-Dīn Baybars al-Malikī al-Ṣāliḥī.

                            God bestowed upon him the most perfect intellect, the best manners, abundant intelligence and vast knowledge. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn mastered the medical art so thoroughly and came to know the philosophical disciplines to such an extent that no one came close to him in regard to anything he undertook. Nor did anyone possess the fine characteristics that were combined in him, including courteous speech and the generous giving of alms to friends and relations, both far and near.

                            Rashīd al-Dīn Abū Saʿīd was the most distinguished of all his pupils, for he attached himself to my uncle, never leaving his side either at home or while travelling. He remained with him in Damascus, always applying himself to study until he knew by heart everything that needs to be memorized from the books that reveal the art of medicine. After that, he studied under my uncle’s direction many of the books of Galen and others until he had acquired an unprecedented understanding of them. He also studied under our teacher, the sage Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ibn ʿAlī.

But there was ill-will and rivalry between the two physicians. When Abū Saʿīd declared to al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ that Abū Ḥulayqah’s treatment had not been the correct one, al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ gave Abū Ḥulayqah an angry look, whereupon Abū Ḥulayqah rose, left the ruler’s presence, and went and sat at the gate of the sultan’s residence. Abū Saʿīd stayed behind with the sultan, intending to undertake treatment, but in the course of that very consultation, Abū Saʿīd was stricken

His death occurred on Monday the fifteenth of Shaʿbān in the year 647 [23 November 1249]. Al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb had enormous prestige and the power of a sultan, but when death – the destroyer of pleasures – came to him, it was as if he had never existed. Thus does time deal with humanity – as I (Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah) have said in the following verses:

Subsequently I met him again in Egypt where he received me kindly and warmly. He had been a friend of my father’s for many years. The death of Asʿad al-Dīn occurred in Cairo in the year 635/1237.</p>

He was without peer in his day and was the authority of his age on the knowledge, identification, selection, and locations of plants as well as the attribution of names in terms of their differences and types. Ibn al-Bayṭār travelled to the land of the Greeks,

                            <hi rend="italic">ʿilm al-nabāt</hi>
                            ) and observed the places where plants grew and examined their nature. Ibn al-Bayṭār had mastered the contents of the book of Dioscorides with such thoroughness that practically no one else could equal him in that regard.

                        <p>Indeed, I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – found him to have an astonishing degree of insight, astuteness and knowledge about plants and about what Dioscorides and Galen had said concerning them. My first meeting with him was in Damascus in the year 633/1235 when I also observed his easy social qualities, the range of his honourable virtues, the excellence of his disposition, the goodness of his character and the nobleness of his soul, which were beyond description.</p>
                        <p>
                            In his company, I inspected many plants in their natural habitats on the outskirts of Damascus. Under his guidance, I also studied his commentary on the names of the medicinal substances in Dioscorides’ book, and so I was able to observe at first hand his vast knowledge and his understanding of a great number of subjects. For my studies with him, I had procured a number of books concerning simple drugs, such as Dioscorides’ book, Galen’s, the one by al-Ghāfiqī,

                            and similar important works on that subject. Ibn al-Bayṭār’s commentary begins with a reiteration of the information from Dioscorides’ Greek book that he had been able to confirm in Asia Minor (
                            <hi rend="italic">bilād al-Rūm</hi>
                            ). It then discusses the whole of what Dioscorides says concerning the attributes, descriptions and functions of plants, and also what Galen says concerning the attributes, temperament and functions of plants and related matters. In addition, Ibn Bayṭār discusses a number of sayings of later scholars and their differences of opinion and also cites instances of error and ambiguity that have occurred in some of their descriptions of substances.

                        <p>I used to analyse those books with him, and I could not find anything in them that he had got wrong. But more astounding still, he never mentioned a drug without also citing in which chapter it is to be found in the book of Dioscorides or Galen, and even under which numbered item it appears amongst all the drugs mentioned in that chapter.</p>

                            Ibn al-Bayṭār was in the service of al-Malik al-Kāmil Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr ibn Ayyūb, who used to rely on him for simple medicaments and herbs and appointed him the chief over the other herbalists (

                            ). He continued in al-Malik al-Kāmil’s service until the ruler died in Damascus, may God have mercy upon him. He then went to Cairo, where he served al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb ibn al-Malik al-Kāmil, enjoying his favour and holding a high position during his reign. Ḍiyāʾ al-Dīn, the herbalist (
