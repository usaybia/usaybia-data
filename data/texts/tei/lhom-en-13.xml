                                    It was [Ziyādat Allāh] who summoned him, but [Isḥāq] imposed on him three conditions of which only one was left unfulfilled: upon his arrival, the Emir was to send a camel to transport him, provide one thousand dinars for his expenses, and write a safe-conduct in his own hand so that he could return to his homeland whenever he desired.

                                    Medicine in the Maghreb started with Isḥāq ibn ʿImrān, and also the study of philosophy. He was a skilful physician, distinguished for his skill in compounding drugs and proficient in the differentiation of diseases. He resembled the Ancients in his knowledge and in the excellence of his talent. Isḥāq settled in Kairouan for some time and composed a number of books, such as his book entitled

                                    Discord arose between him and Ziyādat Allāh ibn al-Aghlab, and they become increasingly distanced from each other, to such an extent that Ibn al-Aghlab had the physician crucified. Isḥāq had asked Ibn al-Aghlab for permission to travel to Baghdad, but the Emir did not grant his request. Isḥāq used to observe Ibn al-Aghlab eating, and would tell him: ‘Eat this, leave this.’ Then a young Jew from al-Andalus came before Ibn al-Aghlab. When Ibn al-Aghlab asked him to join them, he obeyed at once. One day Isḥāq was observing him while eating and said: ‘Leave that, do not eat it,’ but the Jew said: ‘He is very strict with you.’ Ibn al-Aghlab had a respiratory disease: he suffered from shortness of breath (

                                    ). The steward had brought him some curdled milk, and he wanted to eat it, but Isḥāq told him not to do so, while the Jew held that there was nothing to be said against it. Ibn al-Aghlab agreed with [the Jew] and ate the curdled milk, but then during the night he suffered from such difficulty in breathing that it left him at the point of death. He had Isḥāq summoned. When asked whether he had a remedy, the physician replied: ‘I told him not [to eat the curdled milk], and he did not accept my advice. I do not have any [other] remedy’. The attendants said to Isḥāq: ‘Take five-hundred

When Ibn al-Aghlab vomited it along with all the milk, which had turned into cheese due to the cold of the ice, Isḥāq said: ‘O Emir, had this milk entered the ducts of your lungs and stuck there, you would have died from constriction of breathing; but I exerted all my ability and extracted it before it reached there’. However, Ziyādat Allāh [Ibn al-Aghlab] said: ‘Isḥāq has sold my life at public auction. Discontinue his allowance!’
                                </p>
                                <p>When his allowance was discontinued, Isḥāq went to a spacious place in one of the squares of Kairouan and installed himself there with a chair, an inkwell, and sheets of paper. There, he used to write prescriptions every day, thereby earning several dinars. But someone told Ziyādat Allāh [Ibn al-Aghlab]: ‘You have made Isḥāq rich.’ The Emir then ordered Isḥāq arrested and hauled off to prison, but the people followed him there. That night, Ibn al-Aghlab had the physician brought to the palace, where [Isḥāq] told some stories and made some critical remarks that infuriated the Emir because of his excessive unjustness and foolishness. He ordered Isḥāq’s forearms bled, and the blood flowed out until he died. Then the Emir ordered that the corpse should be crucified, and it remained on the cross for such a long time that a bird made its nest inside it.</p>
                                <p>One of the things Isḥāq said to Ziyādat Allāh [Ibn Aghlab] that night was: ‘By God, you claim to be the chief of the Arabs, but you are no chief for them,’ and also: ‘For a very long time, I have been giving you medicines that confuse your mind.’ Ziyādat Allāh, who was already insane, was seized by melancholy and died.</p>

I was sitting that day with a group of Kutāmah Berbers; they asked me about different kinds of diseases, but every time I answered they were unable to understand my words. I said to them: ‘You are but a herd of beasts. None of you are human except in name only.’ Word of this reached Abū ʿAbd Allāh, and when I went to see him he said: ‘You have addressed our brothers the believers of the Kutāmah in an inappropriate way. By the Noble God, if you did not have an excuse due to your ignorance of their state and of the extent to which the knowledge of the truth and the truthful people has reached them, I would certainly have you beheaded.’

                        <p>Abū Jaʿfar ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Abī Khālid, known as Ibn al-Jazzār, was a native of Kairouan. He was a physician and son of a physician, and his uncle Abū Bakr was a physician as well. He was among those who frequented Isḥāq ibn Sulaymān and his colleagues and studied with him. Ibn al-Jazzār was a cultivated man, eager to learn and study medicine and other disciplines, and good at understanding them.</p>

                                    Aḥmad ibn Abī Khālid adopted an admirable line of conduct with regard to his behaviour, his rightful aims, and his disposition. He observed this without committing a single mistake while he was in Kairouan, and he did not indulge himself in pleasures. He attended weddings and funerals, but never ate anything there, nor did he visit any men in Ifrīqiyah, not even the Sultan, with the exception of Abū Ṭālib, the uncle of ʿUmar ibn Maʿadd, who was an old friend of his, and whom he used to visit, but only on Fridays.

                                    He was an important young man in Ifrīqiyah who used to replace [Nuʿmān] al-Qāḍī whenever something prevented him from attending the court. There was no other place to sit but in the vestibule of Abū Jaʿfar [Ibn al-Jazzār’s house]. When Abū Jaʿfar came out, the nephew of al-Qāḍī stood up, but Ibn al-Jazzār did not offer him a seat or a place to recline. The nephew of Nuʿmān showed him a flask with urine that he had with him from his cousin, the son of Ibn al-Nuʿmān, and he received a detailed answer about it, all the while remaining standing. Then he withdrew and mounted [his beast]. But he did not take this as a demeaning chore, and he regularly brought the urine to Ibn al-Jazzār every day until his cousin was cured of his illness.’

                            He was an expert in philosophy, and was also famous for his knowledge of geometry, astronomy, and medicine. Like the philosophers, he sought ethical perfection, a balanced life, and right conduct. He died in his home town [i.e., Seville] in 449/1057.

There were many physicians present, including Ṭumlūn. Each one of them said something about the ulcers, but Ṭumlūn remained silent. The vizier said to him: ‘Don’t you have anything to say about it? Because I have seen that you remain silent.’ He replied: ‘I have an ointment that will heal these ulcers within a day’. The vizier was impressed and ordered him to bring the ointment. He brought it and spread it over the ulcers, and they healed that very night. ʿAbd Allāh ibn Badr gave him fifty dinars while the other physicians left empty-handed.

Five physicians, including Ḥamdīn, Jawād, and others, gathered and collected fifty dinars to buy some of the syrup made from this medicament. Each one of them individually took a portion of it, smelled it and tasted it, and then recorded what they concluded it was by using their senses [of smell and taste]. Then they met, all of them having agreed in their conjectures regarding the [composition of] the syrup, and they wrote that down. They then went to meet al-Ḥarrānī and told him: ‘God has let you benefit from this remedy that you created on your own. We are doctors who bought some syrup from you, we did this and that, and we found this and that. If our conclusions are correct, then we are right; otherwise, share knowledge [of its composition] with us, because you have already gained profit from it.’ Then al-Ḥarrānī asked them to show him their notes, and he said: ‘You made the medicine with its [right] ingredients, but you were wrong in determining their proportions. This is the remedy known as the Great Helper (

He was familiar with [the diseases] that he had seen himself and observed being treated in the East.

He was entrusted with the supervision of some provinces and the tax agencies and, for some time, he was also military commander of the city of Badajoz. Yaḥyā stood high in the estimation of the Commander of the Faithful al-Nāṣir, who granted him a position of trust and allowed him to treat the women of the harem and the household servants. He wrote a book on medicine in five volumes following the method of the Byzantines.

Then [Yaḥyā] said to a person who had accompanied the sick man: ‘Look for a smooth stone for me.’ The man looked for [a stone], found one, and brought it to him.

As soon as the pus that had caused the inflammation had been evacuated, the man opened his eyes and then he urinated, for the urine flowed immediately. Then [Yaḥyā] said to him: ‘You can go, I have cured your disease. You are a wicked man who sodomized his beast. A grain from its fodder that was there obstructed the orifice of your penis and caused its inflammation, but [the grain] came out with the pus.’ And the man replied: ‘I must confess to you that I did that.’</p>

He said that al-Nāṣir suffered once from an earache when the vizier was still military commander of Badajoz. He received treatment, but [the pain] did not abate, and he sent a messenger to fetch [Yaḥyā ibn Isḥaq]. When the messenger arrived, he was asked why he had been sent, and he replied that the Prince of the Believers was suffering from an earache that had defied [the skills] of the physicians. [Yaḥyā] turned aside on his way [to the palace] and stopped by the Christian quarter, where he enquired about a learned man, and was directed to an elderly monk. When Yaḥyā asked him whether he had had any experience treating earache, the old monk replied: ‘[Use] warm pigeon blood.’ When he met the Prince of the Believers he treated him with warm pigeon blood; and as soon as the blood was poured into [his ear], the earache vanished. This was a prodigious accomplishment [that demonstrates] Yaḥyā’s careful examination and perseverance in acquiring knowledge.</p>

He served the Commander of the Believers al-Nāṣir as his personal physician and was also his drinking companion. He was a clever physician, and there are many anecdotes that refer to his intelligence, but he was also conceited, and al-Nāṣir sometimes disliked him for that, though he sometimes needed him due to his great intelligence.

As soon as I had finished them the fever disappeared and I was completely recovered.

                            Muḥammad ibn ʿAbdūn al-Jabalī al-ʿIdwī travelled to the East, where he visited Basra but not Baghdad. Finally, he went to Fustat in Egypt, and there he assumed the direction of its hospital. He was experienced in medicine and excelled in that art, having mastered many of its principles. He devoted himself arduously to the study of logic, a discipline in which his master was Abū Sulaymān Muḥammad ibn Ṭāhir ibn Bahrām al-Sijistānī al-Baghdādī.

Those Greek names that Iṣṭifan knew how to translate, he translated into Arabic; and those for which he did not know of an Arabic equivalent, he left in Greek. He trusted that God Almighty would send someone after him who would know [the names] and render them into Arabic, for nomenclature is but the agreement of the people from each land to name the different classes of drugs as they consider appropriate, sometimes by [etymological] derivation, sometimes by other ways upon which they agree. Iṣṭifan was confident that among those who were to come after him some would know those classes of drugs for which he was unable to find a name in his time, and would name them according to what they had learned in their own time, so that the [drug names] would finally be known.

The people profited from all that could be understood from it, both in the East and in al-Andalus, until the days of al-Nāṣir ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad, who at that time was the ruler of al-Andalus.

Thus, the book remained in al-Andalus while Iṣṭifan’s translation from Baghdad circulated among the people. In his answer to Romanos, al-Nāṣir asked him to send someone able to speak Greek and Latin to teach some slaves so that they would become translators, and the Emperor Romanos sent al-Nāṣir a monk called Niqūlā, who arrived in al-Andalus in 340/951–952.

With the research of this group who investigated the names of drugs of the book of Dioscorides, he had made it possible for their characteristics to be known in Cordova, especially regarding [the plants] of al-Andalus, dispelling every doubt from our hearts; he provided knowledge of their characteristics, and explained the meaning of their names almost without mistakes, apart from a few of them – about ten drugs – with which he was not familiar and about which he had no knowledge.</p>

But toward the end of his life love for wine took hold of him, and he was never found sober or free from the effects of alcohol, and this prevented many people from benefiting from him and his knowledge.

I found him to be an intelligent and conversable man who led a virtuous life; he wore clean clothes and had surrounded himself with notable books on the various domains of geometry and philosophy, and on all kinds of knowledge. He explained to me that he had studied geometry and understood it, and that he had also studied logic and comprehended much from it; but that he had then abandoned those subjects and devoted himself to the study of the works of Galen, which he had collected, supplemented with his emendations and explanations. In that way he had succeeded in understanding the greater part of their contents, but he did not have experience in the treatment of patients, nor was he naturally gifted in the understanding of diseases. He died at the time of the Morning Prayer on a Tuesday, the first day of the month of Rajab in the year 444 [27 October 1052]. He had told me that he had been born in 369/979–980, and thus he was 75 years old when he died [i.e., 72 solar years].’

                                <p>He was an expert in the knowledge of simple drugs, and he was able to understand them better than anyone else in his time; he composed an excellent, matchless book on that subject, in which he masterfully compiled and classified what Dioscorides and Galen had written on simple drugs in their respective works. He once told me that he was eager to acquire [this knowledge], and to classify and explain the names and the characteristics of the drugs that these authors had compiled, and he classified them according to their [medical] efficacy, identifying various degrees. He worked on this for about twenty years, until he felt he had achieved his goal and attained what he desired. He had a delightful attitude and excellent practices.</p>
                                <p>He believed that one should not resort to treatments with medicaments as long as one is able to treat people with foodstuffs, and he thought that, when it was necessary to resort to treatment with drugs, one should not use compound drugs as long as a cure with simple drugs could be achieved. He considered that, if compound drugs were necessary, they should not be administered in large amounts, but in the smallest possible quantities. Many stories about him, and many famous anecdotes about his skill in curing grave diseases and dangerous maladies with the simplest and easiest treatments, have been preserved.</p>

                            states that al-Rumaylī was endowed with a grace that enabled him to achieve a position of privilege, skills to gain experience, which he did, and analytical acumen that impelled him to engage in discussion, which he was prone to do. Some began to follow his model, imitating him, and they competed in calling for his help, and in soliciting his aid to gain power. His soul did not indulge in the mundane, and he always followed the lawful path. Sometimes he treated the destitute, buying medicines and food with his own money; he was loved by both friends and strangers, and all he possessed used to go to acquaintances and friends until old age took him away and [the world] was bereft of his generosity, lamenting the void [he left behind].

                            One of the rabbis of the Jews, he was outstanding in his knowledge of legal matters, and the first who opened the door for the Jews of al-Andalus to know their own laws, their history and other matters. Before him, they had depended on the Jews of Baghdad for their law and for the determination of the years of their history and the times of their festivals. It was from them that they learned how to calculate the number of years that had elapsed since their appearance in history and the beginning of their calendar. When Ḥasdāy entered the service of al-Ḥakam and finally reached a position that allowed him to bring from the East all the Jewish writings that he wished, the Jews of al-Andalus gained knowledge of matters of which they had formerly been unaware, and were thenceforth spared a good deal of trouble and inconvenience.

                            Yūsuf ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥasdāy was gifted in the art of medicine, and also took an avid interest in studying and understanding the works of Hippocrates and Galen. From al-Andalus he travelled to Egypt, and his name become famous there. He distinguished himself in the days of al-Āmir bi-Aḥkām Allāh, one of the Egyptian caliphs,

His term in office lasted three years and nine months, for al-Āmir appointed him vizier on the 5th of Dhū al-Ḥijjah in 515 [2 February 1122], and he was arrested in the palace on the night of Saturday, the 4th of Ramadan, in 519 [10 October 1125], after the evening prayer, and was killed afterwards in the month of Rajab in 522 [July 1128] and his body crucified outside Cairo.

                        <p>While al-Maʾmūn held the office of vizier, he was very ambitious and had a great desire for knowledge. He used to ask Yūsuf ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥasdāy to explain the works of Hippocrates to him, since they were the most precious and important books in that discipline, but also the most abstruse. Ibn Ḥasdāy was equal to the task.</p>

                            Yūsuf ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥasdāy was a heavy drinker, and there are jokes and anecdotes about him in that connection. I have heard that on one occasion, when he was returning to Cairo from Alexandria, he travelled with a Sufi with whom he fraternized and conversed along the way, until they reached Cairo. There the Sufi said: ‘Tell me where you are going to stay in Cairo, so that I can visit you.’ ‘I have no other intention but to stay with the wine merchants and drink,’ Yūsuf replied. ‘If this suits you and you come along, I will see you there.’ These words offended the Sufi, who disliked his companion’s conduct and left for the Sufi lodge. Some days later, Ibn Ḥasdāy went to the market and saw a group of people gathering around a Sufi who was being reprimanded after he had been found drunk in public. When Ibn Ḥasdāy came closer and looked at him, he realized that he was the very same Sufi whom he had met, and said to him: ‘By God, may the

                            Abū Bakr Ḥāmid ibn Samajūn was proficient in the art of medicine. He was particularly well-versed in the properties and effects of simple drugs; he acquired all the necessary knowledge in that domain, and his book on simple drugs is well known for its quality. He worked hard and devoted all his efforts to the task of composing it, and he rendered justice to the ancients by including in it many of their opinions on simple drugs. Abū Yaḥyā al-Yasaʿ ibn ʿĪsā ibn Ḥazm ibn al-Yasaʿ says in

                            Abū Jaʿfar ibn Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Sayyid al-Ghāfiqī was a model of virtue, wise and learned, and one of the noblest men in al-Andalus. He was the most knowledgeable scholar of his time as regards the efficacy, benefits, characteristics, qualities and nomenclature of simple drugs. His book on simple drugs has no equal either for its quality or for its contents. In it, he summarizes the opinions of Dioscorides and the excellent Galen concisely and intelligibly. He then adds new information on simple drugs collected by physicians who lived in more recent times, and anything else that each of them reported and knew about that topic. The book became a compendium of what the most virtuous men had said about simple drugs, and a

                            Umayyah ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Abī l-Ṣalt was a native of Denia, in eastern al-Andalus, and one of the most outstanding scholars in the domain of medicine and in other disciplines. His well-known legacy includes a number of famous books. He excelled in medicine beyond anything attained by any other physician and acquired a knowledge of

                            that few other educated persons have matched. His knowledge of mathematics was unique, and he was versed in both the theory and practice of music, for he was a good lute player himself. As a raconteur, he was witty, eloquent and profound. Moreover, he composed beautiful poetry.

                            Abū l-Ṣalt travelled from al-Andalus to Egypt and lived for some time in Cairo before going back to his homeland. He arrived in Egypt by the end of 510/1117. While in Alexandria he was imprisoned. Sadīd al-Dīn al-Manṭiqī

                            told me in Cairo, in 632/1234–1235, the story behind Abū l-Ṣalt Umayyah ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz’s imprisonment in Alexandria. A boat loaded with copper that had been sailing to Alexandria had sunk not far from there, and no way of raising it could be found, owing to the depth of the sea. Abū l-Ṣalt thought and pondered upon the matter until he came up with an idea. He went to al-Afḍal ibn Amīr al-Juyūsh

                                    That is al-Malik al-Afḍal Shahanshāh ibn Amīr al-Juyūsh (d. 515/1121). His father Badr al-Jamālī (d. 486/1094) was the Commander of the Armies (

                                    ) of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustanṣir. Some manuscripts refer in this passage to al-Afḍal as the ‘King of Alexandria’, omitting his name, and he is also called al-Malik afterwards.

                            and told him that if the necessary equipment could be procured, he would be able to raise the ship from the bottom of the sea to the surface, despite its weight. Al-Afḍal was delighted and asked him to proceed. He provided all the equipment that Abū l-Ṣalt had requested, investing a great sum of money. When the equipment was ready, Abū l-Ṣalt had it placed in a big boat with the same dimensions as the boat that had sunk; making her fast with twisted ropes made of
                            <hi rend="italic">ibrīsam</hi>
                            silk [i.e., probably ‘raw silk’], he had a number of experienced divers swim down and tie the ropes to the submerged boat. He had used geometric shapes to design a device, worked from the boat in which they were standing, that would raise the wreck, and he instructed his crew what to do with it. When they operated it, the ropes of

                            silk were drawn toward them little by little and rolled around the wheels that they had in their hands, and the submerged boat appeared before them and rose almost to the surface. But then the ropes broke, and the ship fell and sank back to the bottom of the sea.

                            Abū l-Ṣalt had acted in good faith when he designed his invention to raise the boat, but fate was not on his side. Al-Malik [i.e., al-Afḍal] became furious with him because of all the money that he had invested in the device, which was now lost, and, although he did not deserve it, the vizier had him arrested. He remained imprisoned for some time, until some notables interceded for him and he was released. This happened during the caliphate of al-Āmir bi-Aḥkām Allāh and the vizirate of al-Malik al-Afḍal ibn Amīr al-Juyūsh.

                                    The story of his imprisonment is quite different in other sources. Al-Maqqarī states that he was imprisoned for ten years in the library of Alexandria after he was captured in al-Mahdia when he travelled as part of a Zirid embassy (

                                    I received a letter from my master and I kissed it before paying attention to its excellent contents or examining them, as if I had held the hand of its author and had taken it from the fingers of its own writer and composer. I saw the admirable and magnificent [words] there assembled, and the jewels set therein, which prompted a flow of feelings. And I saw something that captured my thoughts and my eyes, to which no eulogy or description could do justice. I then made haste to read it again and again from the beginning, to enjoy it in full measure:

                                    You [i.e., Abū l-Ṣalt] wrote [in your letter] that it is necessary to accept the vicissitudes of fate, and that this is only an accidental event that will come to a satisfactory end in the course of time, because you trust in the benevolence of the Sultan – may God extend his days – and in his protection, and you believe all that is known about his beneficence and noble gestures. These are the words of someone whose intention has been purified by God and whose faith He has preserved, someone whose heart and convictions are free from doubt and who finds in His grace a reason to believe in goodness and to be aware of it, someone whom He protects against temptation and sins:

                                <p>You also suggest [in your letter] that whoever undergoes tribulation expiates his past sins and curtails the faults that will come to pass. May God protect this man from faults and deliver him from sin and error! For this is but a test of his trust and confidence in Him, and a trial of his forbearance and clear conscience in adversity; so have the God-fearing endured tribulation, and so have the pure and the righteous been put to the test. And God Almighty guides them according to His plan, determines their share and facilitates their lives with His grace. I once met someone who told me that he was bound to a promise, and that he had vowed to accomplish and keep it, because he had faith in the noble gestures [of the Sultan] for his servant’s steadfast loyalty. He told me that with this in mind, he had waited to seize the opportunity and was watchful until he saw the right moment to step forward and address [the Sultan], and God Almighty helped him to keep his determination and to persevere, and He directed him towards that which he intended and desired.</p>

                                    As for the two poems that he presented to me, I have not seen anything better in its beginning, development, and end; nor anything more captivating to the heart and ear, nor a more amazing source of novelties, a better compendium of eloquence, expression and powerful rhymes; nothing more balanced despite the disparities and antitheses that abound in poetry. The more I read and repeat these two poems, the more beautiful I find them.

On his deathbed he composed some verses and ordered that they should be engraved on his tomb:

                                    <l>before him who gives the world away and apologises!</l>
                                    <l>And I have never seen, before I saw his splendour, a sun</l>
                                    <l>revealing its radiance while rain showers pour down.</l>
                                    <l>O exalted king, with whom Time is exulting</l>
                                    <l>and with whom Bedouins and townspeople are delighted,</l>

                                        so splendid that mantles and striped cloaks are folded up.

                        <p>Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn al-Ṣāʾigh, known as Ibn Bājjah, was a native of al-Andalus. He was the foremost scholar of his age and the leading authority in all domains of knowledge. He suffered severe tribulation and opprobrium at the hands of the populace, who sought his death many times, but God saved him from them. He excelled in knowledge of Arabic language and literature and knew the Qur’an by heart. He is counted among those who excelled in the art of medicine. An excellent lute player himself, he was also well versed in the theory of music.</p>

For his sharp intellect and the eloquence with which he dealt with these delicate and noble themes he was a wonder of the firmament and unique in his time. Philosophical works had circulated in al-Andalus since the days of al-Ḥakam – may God brighten his face – who was the one who brought them, along with books on new matters composed in the East, and translated the books of the ancients and others. They were widely studied, but no one had travelled that path before, and what was understood from them was nothing but errors and misinterpretation. Such was the case of Ibn Ḥazm al-Ishbīlī,

Ibn Bājjah surpassed [Ibn Ḥazm] in capacity of reflection and was distinguished with a more penetrative soul.

                                    Serious study of these disciplines was initiated by this learned man [i.e. Ibn Bājjah] and by Mālik ibn Wuhayb al-Ishbīlī,

He abandoned the study and public discussion of those disciplines when he received death threats on that account, for he was obsessed with gaining the upper hand in his discussions about the importance of the [various kinds] of knowledge. He approached instead the study of the revealed law, and he achieved excellence in that domain, or at least he became competent in it, because from what we know of his opinions, he shed light on these disciplines, but nothing of what he wrote privately could be found after his death.

                                <p>As for Abū Bakr [Ibn Bājjah], his superior talent is evident. He never ceased to apply his capacity for reflection, drawing conclusions, and writing down all that appeared to him to be true, despite the conditions [in which he lived], and the way in which he was treated in his time. He studied philosophy and various aspects of physics; this shows that he had mastered both disciplines, which he conceived of as a single form, of which he spoke and which he surmounted in the way of one who seeks to reach the heights. He left writings on geometry and astronomy that show his excellence in those arts as well.</p>

                                    These, however, are of extreme value, as they show his inclination toward this noble discipline, which is the most important and the ultimate goal of them all: all knowledge that comes before [this discipline] is but an introduction to it and is intended to perfect it. It is impossible to feel attracted to the introductory disciplines that keep the several aspects of existence separated, without [seeking] the completion of all of them, and thus falling short in a discipline [i.e. metaphysics] that is the ultimate goal. Every man of sound mind who has been endowed by God with a talent that raises him above the people of his time and takes him out of the darkness into the light is driven by nature to seek [this knowledge], as [Ibn Bājjah] did, may God have mercy upon him.

                                    ), which is extremely concise but speaks clearly about his grasp of metaphysics (

                                    ), as we have pointed out, and about the introductory disciplines that he had learned previously. Perhaps he ascribed to this [discipline] some things that are not proper to it, but it seems that after Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī there was no one like [Ibn Bājjah] in the domains that he cultivated. If you were to compare his opinions on this topic with those of Ibn Sīnā and al-Ghazālī, for whom these disciplines were already accessible in the East, thanks to Abū Naṣr [al-Farābī], and who wrote about them, the superiority of his opinions and his better understanding of the ideas of Aristotle would be apparent to you. There is no doubt, however, that all three of them were authorities and that they transmitted the most excellent wisdom to which they were the heirs with notable accuracy, for their opinions agreed with those of their noble predecessors.

                            Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah continues: Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn al-Imām was a native of Granada. He was a distinguished secretary who excelled in various disciplines; he was a close friend of Abū Bakr ibn Bājjah for a time and studied with him. Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn al-Imām travelled away from the West and died in Qūṣ.

                                <p>Abū Marwān Ibn Zuhr travelled to the East and lived in Kairouan and Egypt, where he practised medicine for a long time. He then returned to al-Andalus and went to the city of Denia. Mujāhid was its emir at that time, and when Ibn Zuhr presented himself at court, Mujāhid showed him great honour and invited the physician to enter his service, which he did, enjoying the ruler’s favour during his reign. Ibn Zuhr made a name for himself in Denia for his preeminence in medicine, and his fame reached all corners of al-Andalus. He had unique ideas in the field of medicine. One of them was his rejection of steam-baths, because he was convinced that they decomposed the body and corrupted the humours.</p>

                            Abū l-ʿAlāʾ Zuhr ibn Abī Marwān ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Muḥammad ibn Marwān ibn Zuhr was well known for his skills and knowledge, and for the precision of his treatments, which proved his excellence in the art of medicine and his vast knowledge of its particularities. There are anecdotes about the remedies he administered to the sick, and about his ability to determine their states and the pain they suffered without hearing it from them, but merely by inspecting the [urine] vials and feeling their pulse. Abū l-ʿAlāʾ lived in the time of the ‘Veiled Men’, also known as Almoravids.

It had been executed extremely beautifully, and he presented it as a gift to Abū l-ʿAlāʾ ibn Zuhr as a way of ingratiating himself with him because he had never seen the book before.

                                <p>Despite his young age, the name of Abū l-ʿAlāʾ ibn Zuhr was a byword for excellence, and he was praised as a master of knowledge. He never ceased to study the books of the ancients, and it was his constant habit to sit and learn with the masters. Good fortune paved his path towards success, and Fate was not content with bestowing on him merely a lowly standing. He excelled in medicine to a formidable extent, far beyond the reach of those who had pursued it before without being able to understand its complexities; and he took the art beyond the usual limits, with his great expertise and accuracy, for he mastered all the disciplines he studied and was ahead of his time. Ibn Zuhr surpassed all virtuous men in knowledge and purity of descent, and he was also the most magnanimous and liberal of persons. His only fault was being impulsive and prone to use obscene language, but is there anyone with all the qualities of the perfect man in complete harmony?</p>

He acquired an extensive knowledge of simple and compound drugs, and was skilled in treatment. His fame spread throughout al-Andalus and other lands, and their physicians studied his works. None in his time matched his skills in the varied tasks of the art of medicine. There are many stories about the way in which he had come to know of diseases and treatments of which no other physician had been aware before.</p>
                        <p>
                            Ibn Zuhr served the Almoravids, and he enjoyed his lot of luxury and wealth from his attendance on them for some time, until the appearance of the Mahdī Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh Ibn Tūmart, who sent ʿAbd al-Muʾmin to al-Andalus to spread the [Almohad] creed (
                            <hi rend="italic">daʿwah</hi>
                            ) and to clear the way for the propagation of [Ibn Tūmart’s] message and the extension of his empire, taking over al-Andalus and gaining the obedience of the people.

                        <p>
                            The story of the advent of the Mahdī and his ascension to power is well known, as is that of ʿAbd al-Muʾmin, who conquered the kingdom and was recognized as caliph (
                            <hi rend="italic">amīr al-muʾminīn</hi>
                            ). He then came into possession of all the state revenues in the Western Lands, dispensed justice, and summoned scholars and men of learning and showed them great honour. He engaged Abū Marwān ʿAbd al-Mālik ibn Zuhr as his personal physician, and gratified him with luxuries and stipends that surpassed all his desires. He held a respected and powerful position in the caliph’s establishment, and in that time he was distinguished above all his peers. Abū Marwān ibn Zuhr created for ʿAbd al-Muʾmīn the ‘Theriac of Seventy [Drugs]’ (
                            <hi rend="italic">al-tiryāq al-sabʿīnī</hi>
                            ), but then he reduced its components to ten, and then to seven; this last one was known as the ‘Theriac of Anthora’ (

                                    ’s attribution of this antidote to Abū Marwān Ibn Zuhr seems to be the result of a confusion since the case histories collected by the pupils of his father, Abū l-ʿAlāʾ ibn Zuhr, include a recipe to work up the ‘Theriac of Anthora’, which in this case contains seventy ingredients, see ibn Zuhr,

                            told me that the caliph ʿAbd al-Muʾmin needed to take purgatives (
                            <hi rend="italic">dawāʾ mus′hil</hi>
                            ), and that he hated to drink medicines of that kind. But Ibn Zuhr made it bearable for him: he went to his garden and watered a vine with water into which he had poured the medicine. The water had thus acquired the strength of the purgative with which it had been infused or boiled. As a result, the vine absorbed the strength of the needed purgative and the grapes that grew from it contained the efficacy of the medicine. Ibn Zuhr then helped the caliph by giving him a bunch of those grapes and telling him to eat them. The caliph, who trusted his physician, ate them. Ibn Zuhr observed the caliph as he ate, and then said: ‘O Commander of the Faithful, that is enough; you have eaten ten grapes and they will help you to sit on the toilet ten times.’ Ibn Zuhr then explained to him the reason for his words, and the caliph went to the toilet the said number of times, finding relief and getting better. In that way Ibn Zuhr enhanced his status at court.

                            There was a man there who was sick with an intestinal disease (

                            ); his abdomen had swollen and his skin had turned yellow. He was in great pain, and asked for someone who could examine him. Some days later, when Ibn Zuhr was there, the man asked again, and he examined him. Ibn Zuhr observed that the man had an old jug by his head from which he used to drink water. ‘Break this jug,’ the physician said, ‘it is the cause of your disease’. ‘No sir, by God,’ the man replied, ‘for I have no other.’ But Ibn Zuhr ordered one of his servants to break it, and out of the broken jug came a frog that had grown to a great size inside it. ‘That is the end of your disease,’ said Ibn Zuhr. ‘Look: that is what you were drinking!’ And thereafter the man recovered.

                            Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Abī Marwān ibn Abī al-ʿAlāʾ ibn Zuhr, the vizier, was a respectable, wise, cultured and noble man born and raised in Seville. He distinguished himself in the study of various disciplines and learned medicine with his father, acquiring direct knowledge of its practical aspects. He was of middle height, with a healthy complexion and strong limbs, and even in old age he retained an excellent colour and could move with the same vitality, only he became hard of hearing at the end of his life. Abū Bakr memorized the Qur’an and studied Hadith and also Arabic literature and language. No one in his time was better versed in the Arabic language, and it is said that he mastered both medicine and literature. He also excelled at composing poetry and wrote a number of famous
                            <hi rend="italic">muwashshaḥāt</hi>
                            that are still sung and are among the best poems in that style. He also applied himself to legal studies. With his solid religious convictions, his determination, and his love for the good, Abū Bakr was respected, and he used to speak boldly. No one in his time matched him in the art of medicine, and his fame reached all the corners of al-Andalus and also other lands.

                                    Abū Marwān al-Bājī (d. 635/1238) was an Andalusī religious scholar who belonged to one of the oldest and most noble families of Seville. Abū Marwān decided to perform the pilgrimage propted by the political instability in al-Andalus and following the assassination of his nephew Abū Marwān Aḥmad, who had seized power in Seville and adopted the title of al-Muʿtaḍid bi-Allāh [see below

According to the report of his travel, which has survived in several Arabic sources, Abū Marwān arrived in Damascus on the 7th of the month of Ramadan in 634 [4th May 1237] and left the city by the middle of Shawwāl of the same year [June 1237]. It was during this time that he met

                                    , becoming the most important oral source for his chapter on al-Andalus. Abū Marwān provided unique information about Andalusian physicians (especially Sevillians) whose biographies were not included in the sources available to
                                    <hi rend="smallcaps">IAU</hi>

                            None in his time matched him in the art of medicine. Abū Bakr ibn Zuhr served two dynasties: he worked for the last Almoravids, assisting his father; and then he served the Almohads, the people of ʿAbd al-Muʾmin. Abū Bakr began to work for ʿAbd al-Muʾmin in partnership with his father, and when his father died during ʿAbd al-Muʾmin’s reign he remained in the ruler’s service. Subsequently, he served the son of ʿAbd al-Muʾmin, Abū Yaʿqūb Yūsuf; then his son, Yaʿqūb Abū Yūsuf, known as al-Manṣūr; and, finally, al-Manṣūr’s son, Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Nāṣir. Abū Bakr passed away at the beginning of al-Nāṣir’s reign, in the year 596/1199.

                            Abū Bakr ibn Zuhr possessed keen discernment and was excellent at applying treatment and administering care. This was so to such an extent that one day, when Abū Bakr was still a youth, his father Abū Marwān prescribed a laxative for the caliph ʿAbd al-Muʾmin, and when they met later Abū Bakr said: ‘It would be advisable to use this simple drug in place of that other one.’ ʿAbd al-Muʾmin did not take his medicine just then, and when his father met the caliph he said: ‘O Prince of the Believers, he was right.’ He substituted a different simple drug for the original one, to good effect. Abū Bakr ibn Zuhr also created the ‘Theriac of the Fifty Ingredients’ (

                            was a friend of al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr ibn Zuhr and that they used to meet often to play chess together. One day while they were playing chess, al-Ḥafīḍ Abū Bakr felt that his friend was not as cheerful as usual and said to him: ‘What is on your mind? It seems that you are distracted with something; tell me about it’. ‘Yes,’ replied al-Yanāqī, ‘I have a daughter, and I am marrying her to a man who has asked for her hand, but I need three hundred dinars [for the dowry].’ ‘Play, and forget about that,’ said al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr, ‘for I have three hundred dinars less five dinars that you may have.’ They played for a while, and then al-Yanāqī took his leave, and Ibn Zuhr gave him the money. But he soon returned and put the three hundred dinars less five dinars in al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr’s hands.: ‘What is this?’ he exclaimed. ‘I have sold some olive trees,’ replied the man, ‘for seven hundred dinars, and I am giving you three hundred less five dinars in return for that which you kindly gave me: you receive this from me, and I still keep four hundred dinars.’ ‘Keep it all for yourself and put it to good use,’ said al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr, ‘I did not give you that money so that you would return it to me some day.’ But the man refused. ‘By God,’ he said, ‘at this moment I have no need to take it, or to take anything from anyone, either as a gift or as a loan.’ ‘But are you my friend or my enemy?’ asked al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr. ‘I am your friend,’ the man answered, ‘and the one who loves you the most.’ To which al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr replied: ‘True friends do not have anything that they would not share if one of them is in need.’ But the man would not accept it, until al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr exclaimed: ‘By God, if you do not accept it we will became enemies, and I will not speak to you ever again.’ And the man finally took the money and thanked his friend.

He was adamant that no one should engage in those disciplines any more, and that if anyone were to be found studying those arts or in possession of any book dealing with them, he would be severely punished. When he ruled concerning this matter he dispatched an agent to investigate al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr ibn Zuhr. The caliph wanted to know whether Ibn Zuhr had any hidden books of logic or philosophy and was studying them without mentioning anything about it to avoid falling into disgrace.</p>

                                    Ibn Zuhr was investigated, and the orders of al-Manṣūr were applied to all the books held by booksellers and others, so that no philosophical work would survive, and all those who studied them would be humiliated. But one of the notables of Seville, full of malice and envy against al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr ibn Zuhr, wrote a letter claiming that Ibn Zuhr had always occupied himself with those disciplines and studied them, and declaring that he had many books of philosophy in his house. He sent his letter, accompanied by attestations and oaths, to al-Manṣūr, who was then at the Castle of Deliverance (

It was Abū Bakr ibn Zuhr who had advised al-Manṣūr to build his palace in that place and to spend some time at it. Al-Manṣūr was there when he received the letter, and he ordered Abū Bakr ibn Zuhr seized and imprisoned and all the witnesses who had signed the letter convened. But then al-Manṣūr said: ‘I will not hold Ibn Zuhr accountable unless someone brings proof of his culpability. Nothing has been proven, and by God, even if all the people of al-Andalus were to come before me to bear witness against Ibn Zuhr attesting what this letter says, I would not accept their testimony, knowing what I know about the rightness of his religious convictions and his intelligence.’

                                    Al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr ibn Zuhr had taken two pupils to practise medicine with him; they worked together and were affiliated with him for some time, studying some medical works. One day when they met Ibn Zuhr, one of them happened to have a small book of logic with him, and Abū l-Ḥusayn, known as al-Maṣdūm, had joined them because he wanted to study that book. When he saw it, al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr exclaimed: ‘What is this?’ Then he took the book and inspected it, and when he realized that it was a book on logic, he threw it away. Even though he was barefoot, he stormed towards his pupils, intending to beat them. They fled, but al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr rushed after them despite his state,

Subsequently, however, they went to visit him, and on that occasion they excused themselves, claiming that the book had not been theirs and that they had had no reason to possess it: they had seen a young man in the street with the book in question, and they had only wanted to take hold of the book in order to subject him to scorn and ridicule. They had taken the book from him, and, forgetting that they had it with them, had gone to meet their master.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">tafsīr</hi>

The pupils obeyed his orders, acquired the knowledge he had demanded of them, and respected the rules of the Sharia of their own accord and making them their habit, as they had been instructed. However, one day when they were with al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr, he presented to them that book on logic they had brought and said: ‘Now you are free to read this book and others of that kind with me, and to study them.’ They were greatly surprised, but this incident demonstrates his great intelligence and virtue.

                                    the vizier of al-Manṣūr, was an enemy of al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr and envied him. When he saw the prestige and excellence of the physician’s position and the high regard that his work commanded, he conspired against him, intending to poison him with the help of one of his associates, putting the poison into some eggs. Al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr was then working with his sister and his niece, both of whom possessed a sound practical knowledge of medicine and knew how to administer remedies. They were especially experienced in the treatment of women and used to take care of the women of al-Manṣūr; in fact, al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr’s sister and her daughter delivered all the sons of al-Manṣūr and his family.

The father of Abū ʿAbd Allāh was Abū Marwān Aḥmad the son of the qadi Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd al-Malik al-Bājī, who married the daughter of Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Ḥafīd Abū Bakr ibn Zuhr. And from her was born Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad. Abū Marwān Aḥmad was regent in Seville for nine months and then he was treacherously killed by Ibn al-Aḥmar in the year 630/1232, when he was 37 years old.

Abū Marwān al-Bājī left al-Andalus due to the political instability in Seville that Ibn Zuhr addresses in this poem. See above Ch. 13.62.2 and the corresponding footnote.

And when he met the caliph al-Nāṣir in Mahdia, which al-Nāṣir had just conquered, Abū Muḥammad paid him homage in the customary fashion, with the words, ‘O Prince of the Believers by the grace of God, my ancestors and I have enjoyed your grace and benevolence, and the honour that you bestowed on my father has been passed on to me with riches that I will not spend in my lifetime. I have come only to be at your service, as my father did, and to take the place he used to hold next to the Prince of the Believers.’ Al-Nāṣir covered him with honours and gave him wealth and riches beyond description; he sat close to the caliph in the place that had been occupied by his father al-Ḥafīd.</p>

But his father summoned Abū Jaʿfar ibn Hārūn, showed him his son’s eye, and told him: ‘I will pay you three hundred dinars if you cure him’. ‘By God, that will not be necessary,’ replied the physician, ‘I will give him some medicine and he will recover, God willing’.

                            The qadi Abū l-Walīd Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Rushd was born and raised in Cordova. His virtue is well known, as is his engagement with various disciplines. He excelled in law and in the analysis of discordant hadiths, and worked together with the jurist al-Ḥāfiẓ Abū Muḥammad ibn Rizq. Ibn Rushd also devoted himself to medicine. He was an excellent writer with regard both form and content. His medical

                            were close friends, and when Ibn Rushd wrote his book on medical generalities (

                            ) Ibn Zuhr asked him to write a book on particularities (

                            ) as well, so that the two treatises would complement each other and form a perfect compendium on medicine.

                                    ), comprising all the kinds of diseases in as succinct and clear a form as possible. We still need to add to this a further section on treatment, detailing each of the external symptoms for each of the parts of the body. Even if this is not necessary, because it is implicit in the previous sections on generalities, it will be a practical complement, because we shall include in it the treatment of diseases according to the parts of the body – which is the method followed by authors of handbooks (

                                    However, we have postponed this owing to our current commitments elsewhere until such time as we are able to bring it to completion. This book [i.e.

                                    ] has been published, then, without those sections, for anyone will want to look at the handbooks (

As mentioned, it will be a book with sections on particularities in which I shall discuss them in strict accordance with the sections on generalities, with the difference that those sections [of our future book] will deal with the treatment of signs and the occurrence of causes, as is customary in handbooks. There would be no utility in that for the reader of our present book, who will find sufficient the plain discussion of treatment, which, along with the sections on generalities that we have written, will enable him to draw comparisons with the achievements and mistakes in the use of drugs discussed in the handbooks that explain the treatment and care of patients.

                                    The qadi Abū l-Walīd ibn Rushd had a sound intellect, wore shabby clothes, and possessed a strong spirit. He devoted himself to the study of various disciplines, including medicine, with Abū Jaʿfar ibn Hārūn [al-Turjālī],

Ibn Rushd held the position of qadi in Seville for a time before moving to Cordova to serve al-Manṣūr at the beginning of his reign; later, al-Manṣūr’s son al-Nāṣir also held him in high regard. Al-Manṣūr sent for Ibn Rushd when he left Cordova to fight King Alfonso in the year 591/1195.

                                    When Ibn Rushd met the caliph, al-Manṣūr covered him with honours and placed him by his side, giving him the seat that had previously been occupied by Abū Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wāḥid, son of the shaykh Abū Ḥafṣ al-Hintātī, a friend of the caliph ʿAbd al-Muʾmin, who held the third or fourth position among The Ten [followers of Ibn Tūmart].

                                    The caliph also acted against other people of rank and virtue having them exiled to various places.

This took place in the year 505/1198. Abū Jaʿfar al-Dhahabī, for his part, was made head of the students and physicians.

                                    One of the things that al-Manṣūr resented about Ibn Rushd is that, while sitting in one of his assemblies, Ibn Rushd, on his own initiative or perhaps talking to him or discussing some scientific issue, addressed al-Manṣūr as ‘Listen, brother’. Also, Ibn Rushd once described a book on animals, commenting on the various species and depicting each of them, and when he came to the giraffe, he described it and then said: ‘I have seen a giraffe [in the palace] of the King of the Berbers – i.e., al-Manṣūr.’ These words reached al-Manṣūr, who found them offensive, and that was one of the reasons why he took revenge against Ibn Rushd and send him into exile. It is also said that Ibn Rushd apologized, claiming that he had meant to say ‘the King of the two Continents’ (

                        <p>The qadi Ibn Rushd, may God have mercy upon him, died in Marrakesh at the beginning of the year 595 [early November of 1198], just when the reign of al-Nāṣir was beginning. Ibn Rushd lived a long life and left a son who was also a physician, named Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh. He, in turn, left several sons who dedicated themselves to law and worked as provincial qadis.</p>

                            One of the sayings of Ibn Rushd is: ‘The study of anatomy increases faith in God’.

                            Born and raised in Seville, Ibn Ghalindū [i.e., the son of Galindo] was a man of letters and a gifted poet, although he specialized in medicine. He led a virtuous life and was an expert in his domain. Ibn Ghalindū served al-Manṣūr as his personal physician and held a high position at his court. Al-Manṣūr took him into his service when he succeeded to the caliphate in 580/1184–1185. Ibn Ghalindū was the author of many books, and used to write using the two Andalusian calligraphic styles.

                            He studied medicine with him and others until he mastered the art and was able to enter the service of al-Manṣūr as his personal physician. Abū Jaʿfar had extensive experience in the preparation of compound drugs and possessed a thorough knowledge of their components. Al-Manṣūr relied on Abū Jaʿfar for the preparation of the compound drugs and electuaries with which he treated the caliph.

                            Al-Manṣūr had banned wine and was adamant that none should be brought to the capital and that no one should have any in his possession. Some time later al-Manṣūr told Abū Jaʿfar: ‘I want you to collect the ingredients needed to make the ‘great theriac’ (
                            <hi rend="italic">al-tiryāq al-kabīr</hi>

He told al-Manṣūr about it and the caliph replied: ‘Search for it in every corner, and look to see if anyone has any wine, even if only a little bit, so that we can complete the antidote.’ Abū Jaʿfar asked everyone, but to no avail: he could not find any wine at all. ‘By God,’ exclaimed al-Manṣūr, ‘I really wanted to make the antidote, not to find out whether anyone had wine in his possession.’

                            ), and was one of the most virtuous scholars in the art of medicine and one of its most excellent practitioners. He served Abū ʿAlī ibn ʿAbd al-Muʾmin, the governor (

                        <p>At the beginning of his career Abū Bakr was passionate about chess, and was such an excellent player that he came to be known as ‘The Chess-player’. The qadi Abū Marwān al-Bājī told me:</p>
                        <cit>
                            <quote>

                                    I once asked the qadi Abū Bakr ibn Abī l-Ḥasan al-Zuhrī about the reasons that had led him to study medicine, and he replied: ‘I used to play chess constantly. Few others in Seville played as well as I used to do, to such an extent that I was called Abū Bakr al-Zuhrī the Chess-player (
                                    <hi rend="italic">al-shaṭranjī</hi>
                                    ). I became furious when I heard that, and I told myself that I had to turn away from chess and cultivate some other discipline, so that it, instead of chess, would be associated with my name. But I knew that, even if I were to devote my entire life to study law or other humanistic disciplines, I would not reach the required degree of excellence to be nicknamed after them. So I decided to approach Abū Marwān ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Zuhr and study medicine with him. I listened to his lectures and wrote prescriptions for the sick people who came to consult him, and after that I became famous for my medical skills, and the former nickname that I had hated was forgotten.’

                            Al-Nadrūmī had great ability and a noble soul, was loved for his virtues, and possessed a keen, acute intelligence. He was born in Cordova around 580/1184–1185 and raised there. Then he moved to Seville, where he met the qadi Abū l-Walīd Ibn Rushd and studied medicine with him, and also with Abū l-Ḥajjāj Yūsuf ibn Mūrāṭīr.

Later, however, he settled in Seville, where he entered the service of Abū l-Najāʾ Sālim ibn Hūd and his brother Abū ʿAbd Allāh ibn Hūd, the ruler (

                            may God have mercy upon him, heard about him, with his virtue and his exceptional botanical knowledge, and summoned him to Cairo, where he was at that time. The Sultan covered Ibn al-Rūmiyyah with honours and promised that he should be given a stipend and allowances if he would remain with him, but the physician did not stay. He excused himself saying: ‘I only left my land to perform the pilgrimage – God willing – and then return to my family’. He remained for some time with the Sultan, collecting the ingredients of the ‘great theriac’

He studied medicine at the beginning of his career with ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Maslamah al-Bājī, and then with Abū l-Ḥajjāj Yūsuf ibn Mūrāṭīr in Marrakesh. Finally, he settled in Seville, where he served as personal physician to Abū l-Najāʾ ibn Hūd, the ruler (

He was greatly experienced in the art of medicine and had excellent observation skills to detect the symptoms of diseases and determine remedies.

                                <p>I was with Ibn al-Aṣamm one day when we saw a group of people who were calling him. Among them there was a man on a beast, and when we approached them, we saw that he had a snake in his mouth: its head had gone down his throat, and the part of it that was outside had been knotted with a hemp string to the man’s arm. ‘What has happened here?’ asked Ibn al-Aṣamm, and they replied: ‘He always sleeps with his mouth open. [Last night] he had eaten cheese before going to bed and then this snake came along, licked his mouth and entered it while he was asleep. When the snake felt that someone else was coming it panicked and part of it went down his throat, but we grabbed the snake and tied it with this string to prevent it from descending any further. Them we brought him to you.’ When Ibn al-Aṣamm looked at the man he found him about to die of fear, and said to him: ‘Don’t worry!’; and [addressing the others]: ‘You almost killed him.’ He then cut the string, and the snake descended down the man’s throat into his stomach. At this point, Ibn al-Aṣamm said to the man: ‘Now you will heal.’ Ordering him not to move, he took some drugs and infused them in boiling water. Then he put that water in a jar and made the man drink from it. Although it was very hot, he drank it, and then Ibn al-Aṣamm examined his stomach and exclaimed: ‘The snake is dead.’ Then he made the man drink from another jar of water in which he had boiled some stuff and explained: ‘This will tear the snake to bits with the movements of the stomach.’ After two hours he made him drink some water in which he had boiled emetic drugs: the man’s stomach heaved and he almost choked on his vomit, but Ibn al-Aṣamm covered his eyes and he kept on vomiting into a basin until we saw the snake, which had been torn to bits. Ibn al-Aṣamm ordered him to keep on vomiting until he had expelled all the remains of the snake and his stomach was empty, and then he said: ‘Cheer up, for you have been cured.’ And the man went away healthy and content after having been at death’s door.</p>
