                                    ] on his forearm which caused him severe pain. During his treatment of it he felt the need to go outside to the riverside and ordered his servants to carry him to a riverbank where, as it happened, this plant grew. Philon placed some of the plant on his swelling to try to cool it and because of this his pain subsided. He continued to do this for a long time and repeated it the next day until he was cured. When the people saw how quickly he had been cured and realized that it was due to this drug they named it ‘The Life of the World’ (
                                    <hi rend="italic">ḥayāt al-ʿālam</hi>
                                    ), which, owing to frequent repetition, eventually became shortened to ‘World’s Life’ (
                                    <hi rend="italic">ḥayy al-ʿālam</hi>
                                    ). When al-Rāzī heard this, he was impressed and visited the hospital another time, where he saw a child who had been born with two faces in a single head. Al-Rāzī asked the physicians about the cause of this, and when he was informed he was impressed again with what he had heard and continued to enquire about one thing after another, remembering everything he was told until he decided to learn the medical art and eventually became the ‘Galen of the Arabs’.

He then advised that the hospital should be built there, and that is its location.

                                <p>When ʿAḍud al-Dawlah built the ʿAḍudī hospital that is named after him, he intended that a group of the best and most eminent physicians should be employed in the hospital. So he enquired about the most famous physicians at that time in Baghdad and its environs. Now, they numbered about one hundred, so he chose nearly fifty from among them, based on what was known of their qualities and skill in the art of medicine, and al-Rāzī was one of those chosen. Then he narrowed these down to ten, and again, al-Rāzī was amongst them. Of the ten he chose three, one of whom was al-Rāzī, and when he examined them it was clear that al-Rāzī had the most merit so ʿAḍud al-Dawlah placed him in charge of the ʿAḍudī hospital.</p>

Al-Rāzī also authored a book describing the hospital and containing all the details of the conditions of the patients who were treated there.

                                <p>Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥasan al-Warrāq told me that an old man from Rayy whom he had asked about al-Rāzī said: ‘He was an old man with a head as large as a casket. He used to sit in his salon with his students beside him and their students beside them and even more students beside them. Someone would come and describe his symptoms to the first person he met and if he didn’t know the answer, the patient would pass on to one of the others. Al-Rāzī was honourable and esteemed, amenable to the people, and kind to the poor and the sick. He would even give them generous stipends and tend to them himself.</p>

                                    He was constantly writing and copying, and whenever I visited him he would always be writing either a draft or a fair copy. He suffered from moisture in his eyes due to the excessive eating of broad beans (

                                            It is difficult to see why this would be attributed to the beans. Ibn Jazlah,

                                            , mentions some harmful properties of broad beans saying that they ‘dull the senses (

                                    and he became blind toward the end of his life. Abū Bakr al-Rāzī used to say that he studied philosophy with al-Balkhī’.

                                    was from Balkh and used to wander round to various cities and travel in the land. He had a good knowledge of philosophy and the ancient sciences. It was said that al-Rāzī claimed al-Balkhī’s books on these subjects as his own. I – Ibn al-Nadīm – have seen in al-Balkhī’s handwriting a great many draft copies and notebooks on many subjects of which no complete book has ever been published. It is also said that al-Balkhī’s books are to be found in Khorasan. During the time of al-Rāzī there was a man known as Shahīd ibn al-Ḥusayn whose

                                    was Abū l-Ḥasan and who adopted al-Balkhī’s philosophy of knowledge. This man was the author of some books and held discussions with al-Rāzī in which each of them would offer criticisms of the other.

He constantly investigated the obscurities of the medical art and sought to discover its truths and secrets. It was the same with other disciplines, so much so that, for the greater part of his time, he had no want or concern except the study and examination of what the foremost scholars had set down in their books. In one of his own books I have even found a passage in which he states that he had a learned friend with whom he used to study the books of Hippocrates

There are many stories and lessons about al-Rāzī and the proficiency he attained in the medical art, his unique treatment of patients, the deductions he made about the prognosis of their cases, and his experience with the properties of drugs that were unknown to many other physicians. A great number of anecdotes are told of him and are related in many of his books, including some in a particular chapter of his

                                    Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī ibn al-Khallāl al-Baṣrī Abū l-Ḥusayn – who was born into a family of judges – told me: ‘A certain reliable physician told me that a young man of Baghdad came to Rayy spitting up blood – something which had afflicted him during his journey. He summoned Abū Bakr al-Rāzī, the physician famous for his skill and author of writings, and showed him what he was spitting up and described to him his symptoms. Al-Rāzī took his pulse, examined his urine, and enquired about his condition from its beginning, but al-Rāzī could see no indication of any wasting disease or ulcer and could not identify the cause. Al-Rāzī asked the man to give him time to consider the matter, at which the man panicked and said, “I am done for, since even this physician with his great skill does not know the cause.” and his condition worsened. Then al-Rāzī had an idea. Returning to the man he asked him about the water he had drunk on his journey. When man told him that he had drunk from swamps and pools, it occurred to al-Rāzī’s sharp and intelligent mind that a leech had been in the water and had entered his stomach, and that the discharge of blood was due to its effect. He said to the man, “I will come in the morning and treat you, and I will not leave until you are cured. However, there is one condition, and that is that you order your servants to obey me in all I command them to do to you.” The man agreed and al-Rāzī left. Then al-Rāzī had two large tubs of green moss (
                                    <hi rend="italic">ṭuḥlub akhḍar</hi>
                                    ) gathered, which he brought with him to the man the next morning. Showing them to him, he said, “You must swallow everything in these two tubs!” The man swallowed a little, and then stopped. Al-Rāzī told him to swallow more, and when the man said that he couldn’t, al-Rāzī told the servants to take him and place him on his back. They did so, throwing him on his back and holding his mouth open, and al-Rāzī began to force the moss down the man’s throat, pressing it hard and demanding that he swallow it, like-it-or-not. He threatened to beat him, until he had made him swallow, against his will, one of the tubs in its entirety. And all the while the man was crying out for help, but nothing would avail him: al-Rāzī was relentless. Then the man said, “I am going to vomit,” at which point al-Rāzī stuffed more moss into his throat until the man vomited. When al-Rāzī examined the vomit, he found a leech in it that, since it was by nature attracted to the moss, had left its place and attached itself to it. When the man vomited, the leech emerged along with the moss. And the man got up, his health restored.’

                                    which is half way between Nishapur and Rayy. The governor of the city received me, took me to his home, and provided every service. He asked me to look at a son of his who had dropsy (

                                    ) and took me to an apartment which had been set aside for him where I saw the patient, but I had no hope of curing him. So I said some diverting words in the presence of the young man, but when I was alone with his father he asked me to tell him the truth, and so I told him that his son had no hope of living. ‘Allow him to do as he wishes,’ I said, ‘for he will not live.’

When I met him I felt extremely ashamed, for I was sure that his son had died, and since I was the one who had foretold his death, I feared he might find me burdensome. The governor took me to his house, but I did not see anything to indicate that his son had died, although I was reluctant to ask him about his son lest I renew his grief. One day he said to me, ‘Do you recognize that young man?’, pointing to a handsome youth, healthy, strong, and sanguine, who was standing with the servants attending us. When I said that I didn’t, he said, ‘It is my son who you said would die when you went to Khorasan!’ I was astonished. ‘Tell me the cause of his recovery,’ I said, whereupon the man said to me:</p>

I only ask that you keep away the servants (that is, my servants who attended him), for they are persons of my own age, and if I see them in good health, knowing that I am to die, it will cause a fever in my heart which will bring my death on even more quickly.

I thought to myself, I am dying and I do not want to suffer great pain, and I will never have a better chance than this. So I crawled to the bowl and ate from it what I could so that I might die quickly and be relieved. When I could eat no more I returned to my place until you came.’</p>

So I said he was not to be woken until we saw what would happen. He woke at the end of the day, having sweated profusely, and asked to go to the bathroom. When he was taken there his bowels opened and that night and the next day he passed more than one hundred bowel movements, which only increased our despair. After a few days of this and little food he asked for some chicken, which he ate, and his strength began to return after his belly had been stuck to his back. Our hopes of his recovery became stronger and we kept him in isolation and his strength increased until he became as you see him now.</p>

                                    I was amazed at this, but recalled that the Ancients had said that when a person suffering from dropsy eats the flesh of an old and long-lived snake, hundreds of years old, he will be cured. ‘But had I told you that this was his cure you would have thought I was making false promises. And in any case, how can you tell the age of a snake even if we could find one? So I kept silent.’

                            Al-Rāzī also excelled in the study of the philosophical disciplines and composed many books on these subjects, all of which indicate his excellent knowledge and superb mastery. At the beginning of his career he was concerned with magic and alchemy and the like. and composed some works on these subjects also.

Afterwards the vizier contrived to buy one of the maids who cooked for al-Rāzī, thinking that she would cook similar food for him. When she made the food it was not the same and when the vizier asked her about this she said that the food was the same, but all the cooking pots at al-Rāzī’s house were of gold and silver. The vizier then imagined that this was the reason for the quality of the food and that al-Rāzī had acquired knowledge of alchemy. When the vizier summoned al-Rāzī and asked him to teach him what he knew of alchemy, al-Rāzī could tell him nothing and denied all knowledge of it, so the vizier had him secretly garroted.</p>

This is supported by the fact that I have not seen any copy of this book nor have I heard of anyone who has seen it.

He composed great works on medicine and other sciences. He was also an expert translator, and he translated many books from Syriac to Arabic.

It appears that these two dates have been transposed and that Ibn al-Khammār was born in 331/942 and was still alive in 380/991. However, it is more likely that he was born in 331/942 and was still alive in 1039 [possibly confirmed by

Maḥmūd took control of Khwārazm in 408/1018 and Ibn al-Khammār was then taken to Ghaznah at a very advanced age, perhaps even 100 years.

Hence, whenever he was summoned by someone known for worship and abstinence, he would walk on foot to meet him, and would say to him, ‘I offer this walk as expiation for the times I have gone to visit sinners and tyrants.’ Whenever he was summoned by those in power he would ride out to meet them in the apparel of emirs and magnates, often with a bodyguard of three hundred Turkish slaves and with fine steeds and great pomp. But he remained true to his art by being humble towards the weak as well as vying with the great and good. This was the method of Hippocrates

                            The honourable and learned scholar Abū l-Faraj ʿAlī ibn al-Ḥusayn ibn Hindū was among the most distinguished and respected persons in the intellectual disciplines, medical matters, and the literary arts. He wrote delightful prose and outstanding poetry, and is the author of famous literary works. His merits are notable. He was also an excellent scribe and worked independently in that capacity. He studied the art of medicine and the intellectual disciplines under the guidance of the shaykh Abū l-Khayr al-Ḥasan ibn Suwār ibn Bābā, who was better known as Ibn al-Khammār.

                                                Al-Aʿshā (‘the Night-Blind’) is the nickname of several early poets, notably Maymūn ibn Qays (pre-Islamic); the other may be Abū Quḥāfah ʿĀmir ibn al-Ḥārith (Aʿshā Bāhilah, ‘of the tribe Bāhilah’, pre-Islamic) or ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn ʿAbd Allāh (Aʿshā Hamdān, ‘of the tribe Hamdān’, d. 83/702). There is only one famous poet called al-Akhṭal (d. ca. 92/710); there are at least four others, all obscure (see al-Āmidī,
                                                <hi rend="italic">al-Muʾtalif wa-l-mukhtalif</hi>
                                                , 21–22). Perhaps Abū l-Asad al-Thaʿlabī, nicknamed al-Akhṭal al-Ṣaghīr (‘little Akhṭal’ or ‘the younger Akhṭal’) is intended (Ibn al-Muʿtazz,
                                                <hi rend="italic">Ṭabaqāt</hi>
                                                , 330–331) or al-Ukhayṭil (‘little Akhṭal’) Barqūqā (ibid., 411–412), both from the early Abbasid period. The dual may also be a joke on the part of Ibn Hindū.

                            to hunt and find distraction. He was very concerned about his sick son and very protective of him and, in fact, feared for him so much that he would not even allow the soldiers to visit his son. The young man had to stay with his father in a restricted environment and was not allowed to do the things he wanted to do. Now it happened that in the month of Rajab, on the eve of the day on which Bahāʾ al-Dawlah intended to travel, the son contracted a fever that sapped his strength considerably. One of his intimate friends said to Bahāʾ al-Dawlah: ‘The prince is feverish. It is not advisable to move him. Therefore, it would be best to leave him where he is.’

                        <p>But he [Bahāʾ al-Dawlah] replied: ‘No, he must be carried and shall be taken out. No discussion!’ The man replied: ‘But he will die when he is disturbed and the period that he shall remain among us will then not be much longer’. Bahāʾ al-Dawlah, however, would not listen to his intimate friend, but approached the physician al-Ḥasan al-Fasawī, in whom he had much confidence. He asked him to go and see his son and report back to him. The physician went, examined his son, and then returned, saying: ‘It is indeed the proper thing to do to leave him behind and postpone his departure’. He then told Bahāʾ al-Dawlah in a private session about the graveness of his son’s illness and explained its symptoms, which caused the ruler to despair of his son’s life. He then ordered that his son was to be left behind. However, the prince’s fever persisted and he experienced further complications. He died on Sunday, the second of the month Shaʿbān of the year 398/1008.</p>

                            Abū Sahl ʿĪsā ibn Yaḥyā al-Masīḥī al-Jurjānī was a distinguished physician who was proficient in both the theory and the practice of the art of medicine. He was eloquent and an excellent author. He possessed a nice handwriting and was well-versed in the Arabic language. I have seen his book
                            <hi rend="italic">On the Manifestation of God’s Wisdom in the Creation of Man</hi>
                            in his handwriting, which reflects extreme correctness, precision, clarity, and accuracy. This book is his best and most useful work, because in it he has collected the sayings of Galen and others on the usefulness of the parts in the clearest and purest language, with valuable personal additions that point to his dazzling excellence and profound knowledge. In the introduction of his book he states:

                                <p>Only he who compares our words and theirs can have knowledge of the excellence of our contribution. This comparison should be done with knowledge and impartiality, for a person who does not have knowledge of his subject is not entitled to judge it and a person who is not impartial regarding it cannot judge whether or not something is excellent and preferable to something else. The one who is most held in esteem is the impartial scholar, who meticulously examines our contribution and theirs; he will see that we have corrected, improved, supplemented, smoothened and arranged their contribution in a way that is better to the whole discourse and to each single part of it; that we have dropped what is not related to this kind of science and that we have added, each in its turn, detailed and remarkable meanings, which were hidden from them, either for their subtlety or their loftiness; that we have elucidated subsequent matters by former phenomena (as opposed to what they had done), so that the principles and causes of things will be clear, and prove to be true.</p>

After Naṣr’s death in 332/943, however, there was a purge and many Ismailis were massacred. In Ibn Sīnā’s time it would have been dangerous to have been associated with the cause.

                                    I took him aback by verifying that definition in a way the like of which had never been heard before, so that he was completely astonished and cautioned my father against occupying me with anything but learning. And so it was that whatever problem he would pose to me, I would have a better conception of it than he himself did, until I had studied the external aspects of logic with him. As for the intricacies of it, he had no knowledge of them. I then began to study books for myself and read the commentaries until I was proficient in the science of logic.

Then show them to me so that I can make clear to you what is correct and what is erroneous.’ But, in fact, the man had not mastered the book.

Medicine is not a difficult science and consequently I excelled in it in a very short time so that the eminent physicians began to study the science of medicine under me. I tended to the sick and doors to therapies derived from experience such as cannot be described were opened up to me. In addition to this, I continued to attend studies in the law and debated about it. At that time, I was sixteen years of age.</p>

                                    For the next year and a half I dedicated myself to learning and study; I reread logic and all parts of philosophy. During this time I didn’t sleep a single night in its entirety, nor did I occupy myself in any other way during the day. I gathered some scrap paper and for every proof (
                                    <hi rend="italic">ḥujjah</hi>
                                    ) I examined I would set down syllogistic premises (

                                    ) and arrange them on those pieces of paper. Then I would speculate as to what might be concluded from them observing the conditions of the premises until the essence of truth was established for me in that problem. And whenever I was perplexed by a problem or could not find the middle term (
                                    <hi rend="italic">al-ḥadd al-awsaṭ</hi>

                                    I used to return at night to my house, place the lamp before me and occupy myself with reading and writing. And whenever I was overcome by sleep or felt some weakness I would turn to drink a cup of wine until my strength came back. Then I would return to my reading, and whenever the slightest sleep overtook me I would dream of those very problems so that the particulars of many problems became clear to me during sleep. And so it was until I had mastered all sciences and had become conversant with them as far as is humanly possible. All that I came to know during that time remains as I came to know it and I have not added to it to this day; hence I mastered logic, physics, and mathematics. I then turned to theology and read the

But still I could not understand it or its meaning until I despaired of it and said to myself, ‘there is no way to understand this book.’ One day, though, I happened to be in the booksellers’ quarter in the afternoon, and there was a broker with a volume in his hand calling for buyers. He offered it to me, but I refused it in annoyance, believing this science to be fruitless. But the broker said to me, ‘buy it from me for it is cheap; I’ll sell it to you for three silver dirhams for its owner is in need of the sum.’ So I bought it, and it turned out to be a book by Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī

                                    was Sultan of Bukhara. It so happened that he fell ill with a disease which vexed the physicians. My name had become well known amongst them as someone dedicated to learning and study, so they mentioned me to the Sultan and asked him to send for me. Consequently, I came and took part with them in treating him and gained the distinction of entering into his service. One day I asked his permission to enter their library to peruse and read the books therein. Permission was given, and I entered a suite of many chambers each of which contained chests stacked one on top of another. In one chamber there were books on the Arabic language and poetry, in another, books on law, and similarly in every chamber there were the books of an individual science. I looked at the catalogue of the books of the Ancients and sought out those I required, and I saw books which many people have never even heard of and which I had never seen before then nor have I seen since. I read those books and absorbed what they contained, and thus came to know each author’s rank with regard to learning. And by the time I reached the age of eighteen, I had completed my studies of all those sciences, and although at that time I had a greater capacity for memorizing learning, my understanding of it is now more mature. Otherwise it is the same learning, and nothing since has come to me as new.

                                    The Shaykh followed him in his service. Then, having been routed, the emir retreated towards Hamadan, after which the Shaykh was asked to assume the position of vizier. He accepted, but the troops mutinied against him, fearing for their own positions: they surrounded the Shaykh’s house, threw him into prison, raided his estates and took everything he owned, and petitioned the emir to kill him. The emir protected him. but agreed to banish him from the land in order to appease the troops, so the Shaykh withdrew to the house of the Shaykh Abū Saʿd ibn Dakhdūk for forty days. The emir Shams al-Dawlah, once again stricken with colic, sought the Shaykh [Ibn Sīnā], who, again, attended his court. The emir was utterly apologetic to the Shaykh, who occupied himself treating the emir. He remained there in a position of honour and esteem, and the viziership was given to him for a second time.

The Shaykh then placed these quires before him, took up paper and began to examine every subject and write a commentary on it. He would write fifty folios every day until he had completed all of the physics and metaphysics, apart from two books on animals and plants. Then he commenced with logic and had written one section of it, but Tāj al-Mulk

Tāj al-Mulk was routed and went to that very fortress, and when ʿAlāʾ al-Dawlah retreated from Hamadan and Tāj al-Mulk and [Samāʾ al-Dawlah] the son of Shams al-Dawlah returned there, they brought the Shaykh with them to Hamadan, where he settled in the house of al-ʿAlawī.

We were met by the Shaykh’s friends and the emir ʿAlāʾ al-Dawlah’s courtiers and privy counsellors, and the Shaykh was provided with clothes and fine mounts and was housed in a quarter known as Gūn Gunbadh in the house of ʿAbd Allāh ibn Bībī, which had everything required in the way of utensils and furnishings. The Shaykh attended the court of ʿAlāʾ al-Dawlah, where he was treated with the honour and esteem he deserved. ʿAlāʾ al-Dawlah then designated the eve of Fridays for learned debates in his presence with all other categories of learned men in attendance. This included the Shaykh, who could not be defeated in any branch of learning.</p>

                                    the Shaykh accompanied him. One night, conversation with the emir turned to the errors which had occurred in calendars based on ancient observations. So the emir ordered the Shaykh to work on planetary observations and placed sufficient money at his disposal. The Shaykh commenced this work and charged me with arranging the instruments and employing those who would construct them, and, eventually, many problems were solved. Errors had come into the observations due to the difficulties of frequent travel. At Isfahan, the Shaykh also composed his book for ʿAlāʾ al-Dawlah (

                                <p>One of the amazing things about the Shaykh is that during the twenty-five years I spent in his company and in his service, I never knew him to read any new book he had received from beginning to end. Rather, he would seek out the difficult passages and perplexing questions and see what the book’s author had to say about them. In this way, the author’s level of learning and degree of understanding would become clear to him.</p>

At this, Abū Manṣūr turned to the Shaykh and said, ‘You may be a philosopher and sage, but you are not sufficiently well read in the Arabic language to be able to speak about it.’ The Shaykh recoiled at these words and devoted himself to the study of works on Arabic for three years.

                                    He had them bound into a volume, specifying a binding that had been made to look worn. Then he apprised the emir, who showed the volume to Abū Manṣūr al-Jabbān and said, ‘We found this volume in the desert during a hunt. You must examine it and tell us what it contains.’ Abū Manṣūr looked at it but much of what it contained was difficult for him to understand. The Shaykh said to him, ‘What you do not understand of this book is mentioned in such and such a place in works on the Arabic language.’ Then the Shaykh informed him of many well-known works on the Arabic language from which he had learned these words. Now Abū Manṣūr had been talking nonsense in his comments about the well-known words in the epistles, and he now realized that the epistles must have been composed by the Shaykh, instigated by his confrontation with him that day. So Abū Manṣūr retracted his comments and apologized to the Shaykh. After that, the Shaykh composed a book on lexicography that he named

                                    One example of these is when the Shaykh himself was stricken with a headache one day. He conceived the notion that some disease matter was trying to descend towards the membrane of his skull (
                                    <hi rend="italic">ḥijāb al-raʾs</hi>
                                    ) and that the occurrence of some sort of swelling was unavoidable. He had a great quantity of ice brought, crushed, and wrapped in a cloth and his head covered with the cloth. This was done so that the area gained strength and was protected from allowing the disease matter to enter and so the Shaykh recovered.

                                    Another example is that he ordered a woman with a wasting disease (

The judge added to the quire a letter to the Shaykh Abū l-Qāsim, sending it by a rider, asking Abū l-Qāsim to show the quire to the Shaykh [Ibn Sīnā] and to request a brief reply from him. The Shaykh Abū l-Qāsim visited the Shaykh just as the sun was yellowing on a summer’s day and showed him the letter and the quire. The Shaykh read the letter and Abū l-Qāsim’s reply and then placed the quire before him and set about examining it while the people conversed. When Abū l-Qāsim left, the Shaykh ordered me to bring paper. Some quires were cut from it, and I bound five quires each of ten folios in Pharaonic

When I went to him, he was on his prayer mat with the five quires before him. ‘Take these to the Shaykh Abū l-Qāsim al-Kirmānī,’ he said, ‘and tell him that I hastened in answering the points so that the courier would not be held up.’ When I took them to him, he was utterly amazed and sent the courier (

The reason for this was that they had embezzled a large amount of money from the Shaykh’s treasury and wished to see him dead to escape the consequences of their actions. The Shaykh was taken in this state to Isfahan, where he continued to treat himself. He was so weak that he could not walk, but he continued to treat himself until he was able to walk and attend the court of ʿAlāʾ al-Dawlah. But still he did not restrain himself and indulged in intercourse often. He did not fully recover from his illness, but would relapse and then recover every so often.

When they reached Hamadan the Shaykh realized that his strength had collapsed and that it would not be sufficient to stave off the disease. He left off treating himself and said repeatedly, ‘The person who used to look after my body is incapable of doing so and now no treatment will be of any use.’ He remained in this state for some days until he passed over to the precincts of his Lord.</p>

And let one’s own eye be salved by fixation on Him, and let one’s own foot be grounded in standing before Him. Let one’s intellect traverse the highest heavenly realms and the greatest signs of one’s Lord which are therein, and when it descends to its earthly abode then let it glorify God, the exalted, in His works, for He is hidden and manifest; He reveals Himself to everything through everything:

                                    When this state becomes one’s second nature, the impression of the heavenly realms will be stamped upon one’s soul and the holiness of the Godhead will become manifest to it. One will become familiar with the most sublime affection and experience the utmost pleasure and, instead of one’s self, one will focus on One who has priority over the self. Tranquility will pour down upon one and certainty will be realized. Then one will look upon the nether world as one who has compassion for its inhabitants, one who considers its devices to be paltry, its heavy loads to be light, and, due to one’s intellect, one who considers it to be altogether base, and its ways to be but error. And one should remind one’s self as one harps on about the world and takes delight in its delights, and one should be amazed at one’s soul and at the people of the world just as they are amazed at one who has bade ‘farewell’ to the world and is
                                    <hi rend="italic">in the world but not of the world</hi>

                                    And one should know that the most virtuous motion is prayer, the most appropriate stasis is fasting, the most beneficial piety is charity, the most pure inner state is forbearance, and the most vain endeavour is ostentation. The soul will not be free from pollution as long as it pays attention to this or that opinion or discussion or debate or reacts to one state of affairs or another. The best of actions is that which arises from pure intentions, and the best intention is that which stems from the precincts of knowledge. Wisdom is the foremost of virtues, and knowledge of God is the first of priorities. «

                                    Then let one turn towards this soul that has been adorned with its essential perfection and guard it from becoming sullied with disfiguring states of subservience to material souls which, if they remain in the beautified soul, its situation will be at the time of separation as it was at the time of conjunction, since the soul’s substance (

                                    ) is neither polluted nor admixed. Rather, what pollutes the soul is the state of subservience to those concomitants. Indeed, what benefits the soul are the states of dominion, sublimity and primacy. Likewise, one should flee falsehood in word and in thought so that the state of truth occurs within the soul, and dreams and visions become true. As for pleasures, one should practice them only to improve one’s nature or to preserve one’s self or the species or good governance. And as for wine, one should flee from drinking it for pleasure, nay, even curatively or medicinally. One should treat every group according to its own customs and rules, and one should be satisfied with one’s allotted portion and decreed amount of wealth, and one should strive a great deal to assist people, even though that may entail going against one’s nature. One should not neglect the precepts of religion, and one should respect the divine codes and be regular in physical acts of worship. Then, if one secludes one’s self and is free from intimacy with people, one will, all one’s life, be edified by the beauty of one’s soul and by the contemplation of the First King and His kingdom, and one will be kept from the pitfalls of the people

                                                <hi rend="italic">thāʾ</hi>
                                                ‘defect’), but I cannot follow him here. Arberry’s very free translation simply omits the difficult phrases. Dhāt al-Ajraʿ sounds like a typical desert toponym (‘The Sandy Tract’) but is not mentioned as a real place by the lexicographers; the commentary used by Carra de Vaux believes that it refers to the physical world (hence his negative rendering ‘sur une terre desséchée’). Syntactically, however, it is perhaps better connected with ‘her Station’, in which case it should have a positive connotation (a very similar place-name, al-Jarʿāʾ, has such a connotation in a mystical poem by Ibn al-Fāriḍ).

                                                and the feminine suffix in

                                                <hi rend="italic">nafs</hi>
                                                (‘soul’) is feminine in Arabic (as would be the plural); the words
                                                <hi rend="italic">nabāt</hi>
                                                (‘vegetation’) and
                                                <hi rend="italic">ḥiss</hi>
                                                (‘sense perception’) are both masculine. The ‘vegetable soul’ is usually linked with the ‘animal soul’ and the ‘rational soul’; Ibn Sīnā also speaks of ‘human soul’; sense perception is not a separate soul but a faculty of the soul. Perhaps
                                                <hi rend="italic">nafsu ḥissin</hi>
                                                should therefore be emended to
                                                <hi rend="italic">nafsu ḥayyin</hi>
                                                , as a variant of
                                                <hi rend="italic">nafs al-ḥayawān</hi>
                                                (‘the animal soul’). In that case the sense of the line may be that human characteristics are like that of plants and beasts, if bereft of the rational soul.

                            Among the poems attributed to al-Shaykh al-Raʾīs Ibn Sīnā is a poem on the events and circumstances that will occur at the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in the constellation of Capricorn, in the house of Saturn, which is the most inauspicious of houses, because it is the house of Saturn, the inauspicious planet of the celestial sphere, the Great Unlucky planet.

                            and how they massacred the people and destroyed fortresses, in fact happened; we have seen it in our time. One of the most amazing things said in it about the Tatars is ‘Al-Malik al-Muẓaffar will annihilate them’, for al-Malik al-Muẓaffar Quṭuz did indeed annihilate them when he arrived from Egypt with the soldiers of Islam. His defeat of them took place in the Wadi of Kanaan, as is mentioned; it was in Ramadan of the year 658. There are many other things in the poem that came true, such as what it says about the Caliph of Baghdad: ‘Likewise the Caliph, Jaʿfar’ and the rest of the line, and the line that follows: ‘His caliphate is obliterated’,

                            God knows best if al-Shaykh al-Raʾīs really composed this poem or someone else, but it occurred to me that I should quote the poem here, whether it is by Ibn Sīnā or someone else.

                                    <hi rend="italic">ʿAyniyyah</hi>

                                    ). It must have been composed, he thinks, by someone of the lower classes after the destruction of Baghdad. He adds that Ibn Sīnā, with his knowledge of astrology, might have made some general predictions but not such details as are given in the poem. Al-Ṣafadī might also have observed that it is odd that the poet warns his ‘dear son’ in the introduction against events that would not take place for centuries.

Al-Jāzir is identified by Nizār Riḍā as a wadi between al-Kufah and Fayd, which cannot be correct as it is remote from Diyār Bakr. Yāqūt mentions Jāzir (without article) as being a village not far from Baghdad, which is ruled out for the same reason. Perhaps it should be read as Khāzir or Khāzar (without article), said to be a river between Mosul and Irbil (Yāqūt,

His name suggests that he or his family were from Īlāq, a town near Nishapur. Most often it has been said that he flourished ca. 450/1068, since

Others, however, have argued that he was killed in 536/1141 in the battle on the Qaṭwān steppe in which the Seljuq Sanjar ibn Malikshāh (r. 511–552/1118–1157) suffered a severe defeat at the hands of Buddhist invaders from northern China, usually known as the Qarā Khiṭāy (though to the Chinese it was ‘Western Liao’).

                                <p>Sind or Sindh is a historical region of southern Pakistan along the lower Indus River. Inhabited since prehistoric times, it was held by Muslim dynasties from the 11th century until 1843, when it was annexed to British India. Sindh became part of Pakistan in 1947. Al-Bīrūnī was, however, born far from Sind, namely in Kath (nowadays: Beruniy) in Khwārazm, near the Aral Sea in present-day Uzbekistan. Historically, modern-day Beruniy was known as Kath and served as the capital of Khwārazm during the Afrighid dynasty. In 1957, it was renamed ‘Beruniy’ in honour of the medieval scholar and polymath al-Bīrūnī. Beruniy received city status in 1962.</p>

                            Abū l-Qāsim ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad ibn Abī Ṣādiq al-Nīsābūrī was a distinguished physician, well-versed in the philosophical sciences and very knowledgeable in the art of medicine. He had a strong desire to study the works of Galen, and what was written in them about the obscurities and mysteries of the medical art, and avidly explored the theoretical foundations and practical application of medicine. He used intelligible language and was an eloquent speaker. His commentaries on the books of Galen are excellent and well-arranged, an example being his commentary on Galen’s
                            <hi rend="italic">On the Usefulness of the Parts</hi>
                            . He took great pains in writing it and summarized its thematic purport in an outstanding manner. At the beginning, he also says: ‘I have revised the thematic purport of this book, explained the difficult parts, deleted superfluous matter, assembled dispersed items and added material that I found in Galen’s other works and in works by other authors who acquired knowledge in this field. I systematically arranged the information contained in each chapter and appended to the end of each of them explanations of the anatomy of the organ under discussion and its use, thereby making it easier for someone to gather information on the anatomy of any organ or on the use of any of its parts’. He finished this book in the year 459/1068.

                            A certain physician told me that Ibn Abī Ṣādiq had met the
                            <hi rend="italic">shaykh raʾīs</hi>
                            Ibn Sīnā, and that he belonged to a group of disciples who studied under him. I do not regard this report as unlikely. On the contrary, it may be close to the truth, for Ibn Abī Ṣādiq was Ibn Sīnā’s contemporary and they both resided in Persia. Ibn Sīnā’s reputation was enormous, as were his knowledge and the number of his disciples. He was also older and enjoyed greater prestige than Ibn Abī Ṣādiq.

Ibn Khaṭīb al-Rayy ‘The Son of the Preacher of al-Rayy’ is one of the most influential exponents of Islamic philosophy and theology in the era after al-Ghazālī (d. 505/1111), Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī (al-Rayy, South Khorasan ca. 544/1150–Herat 606/1209) rearranged the structure of the philosophical summa in the Islamic East and thus also the curriculum of philosophical studies. His work completes the process of integrating the discourse of Aristotelian philosophy (

                                    ) into Muslim rationalist theology (

                                    ), a process that started shortly before al-Ghazālī. Original in his own thinking, Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī was influenced by the systematic philosophy of Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā, d. 428/1037). His works were widely studied, particularly during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. His commentaries on Avicenna’s works, in which he often keeps a critical distance to

                                    , became the subject of super-commentaries that are among the most influential texts in Arabic philosophy and Islamic theology. Most influential, however, was his monumental Qur’anic commentary ‘Keys to the Unknown’ (

                            (also known as Ibn Khaṭīb al-Rayy, the son of the preacher of al-Rayy), was foremost among the later generations and a leading person among the sages of more recent times. His supremacy has become widely known, and his writings and disciples have spread throughout the world. Whenever he rode out, three hundred law students and others would walk in his retinue.

                            would come to visit him. Ibn al-Khaṭīb had a very strong desire for all the religious and philosophical sciences. He possessed a good innate character, a sharp intellect and he expressed himself well. He was extremely skilful and had a keen insight regarding the art and study of medicine. He had an extensive knowledge of literature and composed poems in Persian and Arabic. His body was plump and of middling stature, and he wore a long beard. His voice was impressive. He delivered sermons in his native town of al-Rayy and in other towns. He spoke from the pulpit about various philosophical subjects, and the people came to him from all lands and regions irrespective of their scholarly pursuits and the versatility of their occupations, and each of them ultimately found what he desired.

                        <p>Muḥyī l-Dīn, the judge of Marand, told me the following story: ‘In Marand, the shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn attended the college where my father was a teacher. He studied religious law under him and afterwards took up the philosophical sciences by himself. He so distinguished himself in that domain that none of his contemporaries was able to match him. I also met with him in Hamadān and Herat and studied under his guidance. His study-circle was imbued with a spirit of loftiness. He even behaved haughtily towards rulers. During teaching sessions, some of his older disciples, such as Zayn al-Dīn al-Kashshī, al-Quṭb al-Miṣrī and Shihāb al-Dīn al-Nīsābūrī, sat next to him, followed by the remainder of his pupils and the other people in order of their rank. When someone had spoken about a certain scientific subject, the older disciples would discuss that topic with him. If a problematic topic or an abstruse concept came up, the shaykh himself participated in the discussion on it and spoke about it in a manner that would defy any description’.</p>

The ruler would later erect a pulpit with a prayer rug for him in the front part of the dais of the mosque in Herat, so that he could sit in that place during celebrations and the masses could see him and listen to his words.

                            also approached and greeted the shaykh, and was invited to sit directly next to him on the other side. The shaykh then discoursed with much grandeur and eloquence on the soul. Just at that moment a dove appeared which circled around in the mosque, pursued by a hawk that was on the verge of capturing it. The dove flew from one side to another until it became exhausted, and then entered the dais where the shaykh was sitting. It flew in between the two rows of soldiers and then moved towards the direction of the shaykh, and so was lucky to be rescued’. Sharaf al-Dīn ibn ʿUnayn told me that he spontaneously wrote a poem about the significance of what had happened and then immediately asked the shaykh’s permission to present it, to which the shaykh agreed.

                        <p>Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn was delighted with the poem, called the poet over to him and asked him to sit next to him. After the meeting, he sent him a full robe of honour and a large sum of money. He remained his benefactor forever after. Shams al-Dīn al-Wattār told me: ‘He only recited these two verses to Ibn Khaṭīb al-Rayy, but afterwards he added further lines to the poem’. I have found these additional lines in his collected verse. They read as follows:</p>

                            Sharaf al-Dīn ibn ʿUnayn has reported that he obtained approximately thirty thousand dinars from Fakhr al-Dīn ibn Khaṭīb al-Rayy and through the fame he acquired in Persia. Here follows another of his poems on Fakhr al-Dīn, sent to him from Nīsābūr to Herat. In it, he congratulates Fakhr al-Dīn on the occasion of the event that the Sultan Muḥammad Khwārazm Shāh put him in charge of matters concerned with endowments and colleges in all the Sultan’s lands, which contain many towns.

                        <p>Najm al-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Sharaf al-Dīn ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad al-Asfizārī told me the following:</p>

                                <p>The shaykh and learned authority Ḍiyāʾ al-Dīn ʿUmar, the father of Fakhr al-Dīn, was a native of al-Rayy. He studied jurisprudence, specializing in the controversies of the different schools of Islamic law and in its theoretical foundations, until he became a distinguished authority, and was almost without rival. He taught in al-Rayy; there at fixed times he also delivered sermons which, because of their excellent content and his great eloquence, were attended by a large crowd. He thus became well-known to all the people in the region. He wrote a number of works on the theoretical foundations of Islamic law and on sermons. He left two sons behind; one of them is Fakhr al-Dīn and the other, the elder, is addressed as al-Rukn. The latter had a smattering of knowledge regarding the controversies between the different schools of Islamic law, jurisprudence and the theoretical foundations of Islamic law, but he was thoughtless and very much unbalanced. He would always follow his brother Fakhr al-Dīn and go with him wherever he went. He would defame not only him, but also those who took heed of his books and words. He would say:</p>

                                        <p>Am I not older and more learned than he is and better acquainted with the polemics of the different law schools and the theoretical foundations of law? Why, then, does the crowd shout ‘Fakhr al-Dīn, Fakhr al-Dīn’, but I never hear them shout ‘Rukn al-Dīn?’.</p>

                                </cit>
                                <p>Perhaps he has written something, as he claimed he did, presenting it with the words ‘This is better than anything by Fakhr al-Dīn’. He would slander his brother, so that the people became astonished at him and many of them would mark and mock him. Whenever word of something like this reached Fakhr al-Dīn, it distressed him greatly. He did not like his brother being in such a situation, with no one listening to what he had to say. He was always kind to him and repeatedly suggested that he perhaps should take up residence in al-Rayy or elsewhere, where he could visit him and spend time with him to the best of his ability. Yet whenever he posed such a question, his brother’s behaviour became worse and the situation would remain exactly the same. This state of affairs continued until Fakhr al-Dīn saw the Sultan Khwārazm Shāh. He informed him about the situation of his brother and what he had to suffer because of him, and asked the Sultan to have his brother confined somewhere where he would not be able to leave and where he would be provided with everything necessary for his comfort and welfare. Thereupon, the Sultan placed Rukn al-Dīn in one of his castles and assigned to him a fief yielding an amount of thousand dinars a year. He remained there until God decided upon his fate.</p>

                        <p>The learned authority Fakhr al-Dīn was the foremost scholar of his time in all the sciences. Crowds came from everywhere to visit him. He also delivered sermons at al-Rayy and maintained a large study-circle. When he spoke, he got the better of all the other orators. He was corpulent, of average height, but had a broad chest, a massive head and a thick beard. When he died at the height of his life, the hair of his beard had turned gray. He often spoke about death and longed for it, begging God to have mercy upon him. He would say: ‘I have achieved all that is humanly possible in the sciences, but I have got so far that now I only wish to meet God, exalted be He, and to glance at his noble countenance’.</p>
                        <p>Fakhr al-Dīn left two sons behind. The elder of the two had the honorific name Ḍiyāʾ al-Dīn. He studied the sciences and acquired a certain insight in it, while the younger one, who is called Shams al-Dīn, possessed extraordinary natural talents and an extraordinary intellect. Fakhr al-Dīn often praised his intelligence, saying: ‘If this son of mine survives, he will become more learned than I’. His excellence already revealed itself in his youth. When the learned authority Fakhr al-Dīn died, his children remained in Herat. The younger son subsequently adopted the name of his father, Fakhr al-Dīn.</p>
                        <p>The vizier ʿAlāʾ al-Mulk al-ʿAlawī took over the vizierate under Sultan Khwārazm Shāh. ʿAlāʾ al-Mulk was a distinguished person, who was an expert in the sciences and in literature and he composed poetry in Arabic and Persian. He married the daughter of shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn. When Genghis Khan, the ruler of the Mongols, crushed and vanquished Khwārazm Shāh and killed the majority of his soldiers, and Khwārazm Shāh himself was missing, ʿAlāʾ al-Mulk went to see Genghis Khan and sought refuge with him. When he arrived there, Genghis Khan received him with honours and made him one of his courtiers. When the Mongols occupied Persia, and destroyed its castles and cities and slaughtered all the citizens, sparing no one’s life, ʿAlāʾ al-Mulk, perceiving that a part of the Mongol army was headed for Herat to destroy the city and kill all its inhabitants, approached Genghis Khan and asked him to ensure the protection of the children of shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn ibn Khaṭīb al-Rayy and to have them brought honourably into his presence. Genghis Khan granted him this request and promised safe conduct for them. When the soldiers were advancing to occupy Herat, they announced that the children of Fakhr al-Dīn ibn al-Khaṭīb, having been granted protection, should stay in a secluded place, where they would be safe. Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn’s house in Herat had been presented to him by Sultan Khwārazm Shāh. It was one of the largest, most beautiful and most richly decorated houses, which always had been well attended by visitors. When the children of Fakhr al-Dīn heard of the announcement, they confidently remained in that house, but were joined there by an enormous crowd, which included inhabitants of the town, relatives, state officials, local notables, many lawyers and others, who thought they would be safe because of their relationship to the children of Fakhr al-Dīn and particularly by their presence in that house. The Mongols, after entering the town, killed everyone they encountered and when they ultimately got to the house, called upon Fakhr al-Dīn’s children to make themselves known. When they saw the children, they led them aside, and then massacred all the other people in the house. They brought the children of shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn from Herat to Samarkand because the ruler of the Mongols, Genghis Khan, was there at the time, and so was ʿAlāʾ al-Mulk. I say: ‘I do not know what happened to them thereafter’.</p>

                        <p>I – ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say: Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn resided for most of his life in al-Rayy, but he also went to the region of Khwārazm, where he was taken ill. He subsequently died in Herat as the result of his illness. When his illness reached its climax, he dictated a declaration to his disciple Ibrāhīm ibn Abī Bakr ibn ʿAlī al-Iṣfahānī. This was on Sunday, the twenty-first day of the month Muḥarram of the year 606 [26 July 1209]. He was ill for a long time, but then died on the first day of the month Shawwāl of the year mentioned, and went to the presence of his Lord, May God, exalted be He, have mercy upon him.</p>
                        <p>Here is the text of his testament:</p>
                        <cit>
                            <quote>
                                <p>
                                    In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Thus speaks the servant, Muḥammad ibn ʿUmar ibn al-Ḥusayn al-Rāzī, who, hoping for the mercy of his Lord and trusting in the gracious beneficence of his Master, is spending his last days in this world and is standing on the threshold of the hereafter, this being the time when every hard-hearted person will soften and every fugitive slave returns to his master. I laud God, exalted be He, with the praises uttered by his most sublime angels on the most elevated rungs of their ladders, and spoken by his greatest prophets in the most perfect moments of their visions. But I say that all of it is the result of what has already occurred and what may yet take place. Therefore, I laud Him with the praises that his divine nature and perfect gifts merit, whether I am conscious of them or not, because there is no conformity between dust and the majesty of the Lord of Lords. I pray for the angels close to Him, the prophets sent by Him and all the righteous servants of God. And I say further: Be it known to you, my brethren in faith and companions in the quest for truth, that people say: In general, when one dies one’s connections with the living are severed, except that (1) one’s good works live on in the world. These good works become a motive for prayer, which leaves a trace with God, and (2) there are the interests of one’s children, wives, the pursuit of unjust acts and the perpetration of crimes. With regard to the first aspect, be it known to you that I was a person, devoted to science, who has written about all kinds of things. No matter whatever quantity or quality I came across, whether true or false, fat or lean (i.e. weighty or trivial), I always saw in the writings I considered that this sensible world is under the direction of a Director who is transcendent above any resemblance to things that are limited in compass (
                                    <hi rend="italic">mutaḥayyizāt</hi>
                                    ) and accidentia, and whose attributes are perfect omnipotence, omniscience, and mercy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I explored the paths of scholastic theology and the roads of philosophy, but I did not derive the same benefit from them that I have encountered in the glorious Qur’an, because the latter is capable of preserving the majesty and splendour of God, exalted be He, in their entirety, and prevents one from immersing oneself in efforts to identify contradictions and inconsistencies. It is only in science that human intellects become frustrated and fade away in these profoundly confined and hidden places. Therefore, I say: the person whom I would support most is he who sticks to outward signs such as His Necessary Existence, His Oneness, His design [of life], His effect [on people] and the fact that He stands above eternity and is not subject to time. May such a person receive divine inspiration from God, exalted be He. And if this matter leads to lack of clarity and obscurity, then the religious authorities should reach agreement on everything that is said in the Qur’an and the sound traditions and converge upon one meaning. So be it! And if such is not the case, I say: O Lord of all beings, I see mankind agreeing that You are the most generous and merciful one. You know what my pen cannot describe or what will come up in my mind. Therefore, I call upon Your knowledge and say: If You know from me that I have intended to state as true what is false, and to state as false what is true, then do with me as I deserve. But if You know from me that I merely strove to establish that in which I firmly believed and what I imagined to be just, then let Your mercy be with my intention and not with what I did in the end. There is nothing more that the wretched can do. You are much too noble to become annoyed at a weak person for committing an error, therefore save me, have mercy upon me, overlook my error, and efface my sin. You, whose sovereignty cannot be increased by the knowledge of those who know you, nor is diminished by the errors of evildoers. I say: my religion follows Muḥammad, the Lord of the Messengers, and my book is the glorious Qur’an. I depend on both of them to pursue my religion. O God, You who hear what people are saying, who answer prayers, who make offences undone, who have mercy for the things people are saying and who support new things and make them possible, I think well of You and have a great hope in Your mercy. You say: «

                                    to do his utmost in the education of my son Abū Bakr, for the marks of intelligence and cleverness are manifest in him. Perhaps God, exalted be He, will let him attain goodness. Hereby I command him and all my disciples and all who are indebted to me that, at the hour of my death, they should go to the greatest lengths in the concealment of my death and do not let anyone know about it. Then, they should cover me in a shroud for the grave and bury me according to the stipulations of the religious law. Let them carry me to the mountain that is near to the village of Mazdākhān [or: Mazdāqān]

Then they should sprinkle the earth over me and after it is all concluded they should say: O Generous one, this wretched soul has come to You. Deal graciously with him!

                                        Two Arabic manuscripts have preserved treatises on geomancy attributed to Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī, one of them a didactic poem (

                                        ). There is also a section on geomancy in the Persian encyclopaedia of Muslim science,

                            The authority Quṭb al-Dīn Ibrāhīm ibn ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad al-Sulamī was originally from North Africa, but moved to Egypt, where he resided for a while. Afterwards, he travelled to Persia and gained fame there. He studied under the guidance of Fakhr al-Dīn, the son of the preacher of al-Rayy and became one of his most distinguished disciples. He wrote many books on medicine and philosophy, including a commentary on the whole of the ‘Generalities’ of Ibn Sīnā’s

He lived in Diyarbakir and Azerbaijan. In his algebraic epistles he refuted Ibn al-Khashshāb, the grammarian, his contemporary, who shared his interest in arithmetic and had some insight in the subject of algebra.</p>

                                    He lived in the city of Marāghah and there begot children, who like him followed the path of medicine. He then moved to Mosul and Diyarbakir, embraced Islam and became a true Muslim. He wrote a book, in which he demonstrated the shortcomings of the Jews, the untruth of their claims regarding the Pentateuch and the passages therein that furnish evidence of its abrogation. He assembled this material very skilfully.
