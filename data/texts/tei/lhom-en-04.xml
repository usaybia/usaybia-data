                            Let us begin by reporting some specific information about Hippocrates himself and the divine favour he enjoyed. Then, we will provide an account of all the Greek physicians to whom Hippocrates transmitted this art, even if they were not among the descendants of Asclepius. Hippocrates, as we have discussed, was in fact the seventh of the celebrated great Greek physicians, whose forefather was Asclepius.

                            Hippocrates was one of the most noble and eminent men of his family. According to what I have found in some reports translated from the Greek,

                            Hippocrates’ ancestors were: Heracleides (his father), Hippocrates, Gnosidicus, Nebrus, Sostratus, Theodorus, Cleomyttades, and Crisamis the king.

                            Hippocrates was naturally endowed with nobility and rank, for he was a ninth-generation descendant of the king Crisamis, a descendant of Asclepius in the eighteenth generation, and of Zeus in the twentieth-generation. Moreover, Hippocrates’ mother was Praxitela, daughter of Phaenarete, of the house of Heracles. His noble origin stemmed, then, from two sources, since his father was a descendant of the family of Asclepius and his mother that of Heracles.

                            Hippocrates learnt medicine from his father Heracleides and his grandfather Hippocrates. They both passed on to him the principles of this art. He lived ninety-five years, sixteen of them as a child and student, seventy-six as a scholar and master – only two years passed between the death of Asclepius

                            When Hippocrates looked at the state of medicine, he feared for the survival of this art, for he had seen it disappearing from the majority of the places in which Asclepius had established its teaching. The locations where the art of medicine was taught, as Galen records in his commentary on the

                            Medical knowledge soon disappeared in Rhodes because its masters left no successors behind; and it died out in Knidos because Asclepius’ descendants were all too few; only Kos, the city in which Hippocrates lived, kept the art alive thanks to a small number of Asclepius’ descendants who remained there.
                        </p>
                        <p>When Hippocrates reflected upon the state of medicine, he realized that it was about to disappear because those who inherited this art among the family of Asclepius were too few. Upon that, he resolved to spread the art to all lands, to bring it to the rest of the people, and to teach it to all those who were worthy of learning it lest it disappeared. Hippocrates claimed that the gift of doing good should be given to anyone worthy of it, whether he was from the family (of Asclepius) or not. And so, he attracted strangers and taught them this precious art. He made them hold true to the vow he composed and bound them by the celebrated oaths to promise not to offend against the rules imposed upon them, and not to teach this art to anyone who had not previously taken this vow.</p>

                                            it is said that ‘he was taken up to the angels in a column of fire’ (see Ch. 2.1.6.2.). Al-Bīrūnī, also referring to the commentary on the
                                            <hi rend="italic">Oath</hi>
                                            , states that ‘Asclepius was a man of divine nature (
                                            <hi rend="italic">rajul ilāhī</hi>
                                            ) who brought the art of medicine to humans’; al-Bīrūnī quotes Plato’s
                                            <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi>
                                            to gloss this notion of divinity, stating that they receive this name because they do not die, and that they are ‘the angels’ (
                                            <hi rend="italic">Taḥqīq mā li-l-Hind</hi>
                                            , 26). Al-Bīrūnī also refers to God’s assimilating Asclepius to the angels (
                                            <hi rend="italic">jaʿalahu malʾak min al-malāʾikah</hi>
                                            ) (

                                            , 28). In this and similar cases, angel is a translation of

                                    Be that as it may, the fact is that Asclepius was the first to teach medicine and he is credited with having the first student. According to ancient practice, the student used to call his master ‘father’, and it is from this first student that the families related to Asclepius descend. They were the Greek Kings and their notables, for no others were allowed to learn medicine. This art was their prerogative and each of them taught it to his children or grandchildren alone.

                                    Medicine used to be taught orally. They did not write it down in books, and whenever they needed to commit something to writing they used symbolic language that no-one but themselves could understand and which fathers would explain to their sons. Medicine was the exclusive competence of kings and ascetics, who would tend the people unconditionally without taking a fee. Such was the situation until the appearance of Hippocrates from Kos and Democritus from Abdera, who were contemporaries. Democritus embraced an ascetic life and abandoned his position as administrator of his city.

                                    As for Hippocrates, in view of the disagreements about medical matters that arose among the members of his house, he feared this would fall into decay so he resolved to write it up in a complex way.

                                    He instructed them in this art to make it sure that it would spread beyond the Asclepiad family and reach other people. He established a covenant that the students had to follow to remain pure and virtuous, wrote a law (

Those who fulfil this oath without contravening any of its dispositions shall excel in their conduct and in their art in the most perfect and noble way, and will forever be praised by everybody.

                                <p>Hippocrates said: Medicine is of all the arts the most noble, but the poor judgment of many of those who claim to practice it attracts the criticism of people. No blame should be imputed to medicine in any city, but rather to the ignorance of those who claim to be physicians without being worthy of bearing that name. For they are like the images that storytellers use to amuse the people: just as these figures are bereft of real existence, these physicians are much in name, but amount to very little in deed.</p>
                                <p>Whoever desires to learn the art of medicine should have a good and suitable nature, great enthusiasm and absolute determination. But the most important of all is nature: he who has an adequate nature should engage in study without succumbing to distress, and knowledge will become instilled in his mind and bear wonderful fruits, as we see plants do in earth. For nature is like fertile soil, education like agriculture, and cultivating knowledge like sowing seeds in fertile ground.</p>
                                <p>When passion for medicine takes hold of students, as we have mentioned, they return to the cities not as physicians in name, but in deed. The knowledge of medicine is a wonderful treasure and a precious resource for those who learn it with pleasure, in private or public. But the ignorance of this art among those who claim to know it is a calamity, and a wicked treasure that brings no joy, but everlasting anxiety and imprudence; and anxiety is a sign of weakness, while imprudence shows lack of experience in the discipline.</p>

                                    Hippocrates says: The student of medicine ought to be a free man with a good nature, young, and of regular stature and proportionate members. He should have excellent discernment and oral skills, demonstrate good judgment when taking part in deliberations, be chaste and brave, not infatuated with money, able to restrain himself when angered; but he does not hold back in extremes, nor is vacuous. He should sympathize and be compassionate with the patients, and keep their secrets because many of the sick people whom we visit suffer diseases about which they do not want anyone to know. If he is insulted, he should be forbearing because we experience this with people affected by delirium (
                                    <hi rend="italic">mubarsimūn</hi>
                                    ) and melancholy (

                                    ); we should be patient with them and know that this behaviour is not intentional, but rather the result of non-natural factors.

Following the humoral system of Galen, medieval physicians believed that health depended on the equilibrium of the natural elements, the presence of which is essential for the mere existence of bodies, and the action of the non-naturals, which were essential factors to preserve the equilibrium of the seven naturals, see Pormann and Savage-Smith,

                                <p>The hair of the student should be proportionately and evenly trimmed, not completely shaved or let to grow in excess. He should not clip his fingernails too short nor let them grow beyond the tip of the fingers. His clothes should be white, clean, and soft. The physician should not walk hastily, since this indicates fickleness, nor ploddingly, for this is a sign of a weak spirit. When attending the sick, he should sit cross-legged to hear about their state in silence, calmly and without any kind of disturbance. These forms of etiquette and conduct are better for me than any other.</p>

                                    In addition to all that Hippocrates learnt about medicine, the knowledge of astronomy he attained was unmatched by anyone in his time. Hippocrates studied the elements that form the bodies of the animals and that determine the coming into existence and the end of all perishable bodies.

                            Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah continues: If we pay attention to Hippocrates’ practice and treatment, we see that he always showed great interest in helping and tending the sick. It is said that he was the first one who conceived of and established a hospital. He used to work in a garden close to his house, a section of which was reserved for the sick; then he provided servants to take care of their treatment and called it
                            <hi rend="italic">xenodocheion</hi>
                            , i.e. ‘a place to host the sick’.

                                    The Arabic transliteration of the Greek ξενοδοχεῖον reads
                                    <hi rend="italic">akhshundūkīn</hi>
                                    ; the term means, ‘a place for strangers’. In late antiquity, this was an ecclesiastical charitable institution that often served as hospital, see

                            This is also the meaning of the Arabic term for hospital,
                            <hi rend="italic">bīmāristān</hi>
                            , which comes from Persian:

                            means sick and

                            means place, and thus the meaning of

                            is ‘a place for the sick’.

                            Hippocrates did not abandon himself to this comfortable life for the rest of his days: he continued his research on medicine, establishing its rules, treating and providing relief to the sick, and healing their maladies and diseases. Many stories about the patients he treated are recorded in the book known as

                            Hippocrates never coveted riches by serving the kings; the needs of the destitute were for him more important than augmenting his own wealth. That is why Galen says

                            All this shows – as Galen states – that Hippocrates not only despised riches, but also contentment and comfort: he opted for embracing virtue in hardship and distress.

Bahman took pity on these people and let Hippocrates stay with them. Hippocrates was active and well-known in the year ninety-six of the Era of Nebuchadnezzar,

                                    claimed in his book that he could know a man’s character through his physical traits. One day, when the students of Hippocrates were together, one of them said to his colleagues, ‘Do you know of anyone better in our days than this exceptional man?’ Some answered that they did not know of anyone better, but one of them said: ‘Wait, let us examine him by applying Polemon’s claims about physiognomic science’. They drew a picture of Hippocrates, handed it to Polemon and told him: ‘O excellent man, look at this picture and tell us about the moral characteristics of his soul that his physical traits reveal’. He looked at it, made a comparison of his body parts and then he pronounced his opinion, saying: ‘This is a man who loves fornication’. The students replied: ‘You are lying! This is the picture of Hippocrates the sage’. But Polemon said: ‘My theory cannot be wrong’. The students asked again, but he rejected the accusation of being a liar. Then they went back to meet Hippocrates, and when they told him what they had done and what was the opinion of Polemon, he replied: ‘Polemon was right, I certainly like fornication, but I restrain myself!’ This illustrates the excellence of Hippocrates, his self-control and how he exercised his soul with virtue.

                                    Hippocrates was tall, white-skinned, and handsome; he had pale blue eyes, big bones and prominent tendons, an evenly trimmed white beard, and a hunched back. He was tall and moved slowly, and when he looked back he used to turn around his full body. Hippocrates bowed his head constantly, always had the right words and used to speak calmly and repeating his words to his listeners. When he was seated, his shoes where always in front of him. When asked, he replied; when no one talked to him, he asked; and he used to stare at the ground while sitting. He was playful, frugal and prone to fasting. He always carried a scalpel (

                            ) and that in his will he disposed that an ivory chest should be buried with him, but nobody knew its contents. Caesar, the king, passed once by this tomb; he found it in a derelict state, and ordered it to be renovated. It was customary among kings to visit wise men during their life and after their death because they were the most exceptional of men and the closest to them. Caesar ordered the grave to be dug up, and when they opened it for him to see its contents, they found that this chest contained twenty-five discussions of mortal diseases of unknown origin, even though the death was diagnosed for prescribed times and particular days. This work has been translated into Arabic and some people claim that Galen wrote a commentary on it, but this is unlikely. If it were true and Galen’s commentary had existed, it would have been translated into Arabic as it has been done with the other commentaries of Hippocrates that he wrote and that have been translated all together.

                                        The ‘marriage of death’ topos is widespread in classical literature. This maxim seems to have adapted here by playing with the meanings of the word

                                        , which means both husband and – metaphorically – tomb. There is an Arab proverbial expression, sometimes presented as a prophetic saying, that states: ‘An excellent son-in-law – or husband in general – is the grave (

                            <item>Hippocrates once admitted a very young student in his class. The elder students complained about promoting him before them, and he asked, ‘Do you not know why he has been promoted before you?’ ‘No’, they replied. And then he asked, ‘What is the most wonderful thing in the world?’ One of them answered, ‘The sky with its stars and planets’. Another said, ‘The earth, with its animals and plants’. Another said, ‘Man and his making’. They all went on saying something different to which Hippocrates always replied, ‘No’. Finally, he asked the young student, ‘What is the most wonderful thing in the world?’ And he replied, ‘O wise man, if all that exists in the world were a wonder, there would be no wonder’. And the wise Hippocrates said, ‘This is why I promoted him, because of his cleverness’.</item>

                                The heart suffers from two kinds of harm: sorrow (

                                ) and worry (

                                ). Sorrow affects him during sleep, and worry during wakefulness. This is because anxiety appears when someone reflects with fear about that what is to come, which needs wakefulness. Sorrow, however, does not involve any reflection, because it only feeds on that which is past and finished.

                                <p>Passion is a desire originated in the heart, where the materials of desire come together. Whenever passion gains strength, the one experiencing it becomes more excited, insistent and stubborn, his agitation intensifies and he increasingly suffers from insomnia. In this state, blood burns and turns into black bile, and yellow bile is inflamed and transformed into black bile. The excessive flood of black bile impairs the rational abilities, provoking confusion, unsound reasoning, longing for that which does not exist, and desire for that which is unattainable, to such an extent that it results in madness.</p>
                                <p>In this state, the lover may kill himself or die of sorrow; or attain the object of his desire and then die of happiness or sadness. He may also exhale such profound a sigh that his spirit will abandon his body for twenty-four hours, and he be taken for dead and be buried alive. Or he may breathe so deeply that his soul will be constricted within his pericardium, and the heart will close around it without letting it go, and cause his death; or perhaps, when the lover is relaxed, the sudden sight of the one he loves may excite his desire, and his soul depart from him, suddenly and at once. You will see how blood flow away from the lover and his colour changes at the mere mention of the one he loves.</p>
                                <p>Only the mercy of the Lord of the Worlds can put an end to this state, for there is no remedy in the hands of men. When a malignant affection stems from a single, independent cause, it might be easily terminated by ending its cause; but when two causes occur simultaneously and they occasion each other reciprocally, there is no way of ending either one of them. Black bile provokes an uninterrupted train of thought [in the infatuated person], and this is the cause of the burning of the blood and of the yellow bile, which results in their conversion into black bile. Whenever black bile becomes predominant, the more intense the thoughts are; and the stronger these thoughts are, the more predominant black bile becomes: this is the fatal disease that physicians are incapable of treating.</p>

                                Hippocrates said to one of his students: ‘Let your best practice be your love for the people, and your preoccupation with knowing their problems and conditions, and for doing them good’.

                            Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah continues: Hippocrates was the first to set down the art of medicine in writing. As we said before, he divulged it and made it well known. The method he adopted in composing these books took three forms of instruction: the first was the use of enigmatic language, the second to write in as succinct and compendious a form as possible, and the third to do so by way of facilitating and explaining the material. That which has come down to us from Hippocrates in reports or as books genuinely ascribed to him amounts to thirty works. The books of Hippocrates used by the students of medicine when the right principles and order are followed are twelve, and they are more famous that his other books:

                                which consists of three books dealing with the symptoms that the physician finds in the different stages of the disease, past, present, and future. The physician knows that when he gives information about the past he gains the trust of the patient, who then complies with his instructions, and in this way he can apply his treatment as required. When the physician knows the present, he confronts [the disease] with the right medicines and treatments. And when he anticipates the future he prepares himself for all that he has to face, and will not be surprised and run out of time to treat what he encounters as required.

                                This work consists of seven books containing an exposition of the visiting diseases, their care and treatment. Hippocrates states that these diseases are of two kinds: one is an ordinary disease; the other one is mortal and known as ‘the great death’.

                                The physician should treat each one of them accordingly. In this book, Hippocrates also includes personal notes. Galen said: ‘I and other commentators know that books four, five and seven from this work are apocryphal and were not written by Hippocrates’. He also explains that the first and third books deal with the ‘visiting’ diseases, and that books two and six are in fact Hippocrates’ personal notes, either composed by the author himself or by his son, who might have put into writing what he heard from his father in this note-book form – this according to Galen’s explanation. Galen also said that books four, five, and seven of this work should be avoided, and so they came to be lost.

                                This work consists of three books and it is useful for learning the procedures needed by the physician in relation to his surgical tasks, such as knotting and tightening threads, setting, suturing, reducing dislocated limbs, keeping moist and applying hot compresses, and all required skills. Galen said that Hippocrates made the rule that this should be the first of his books to be read by students, and all other commentators held the same opinion, including myself.

                            Marius received this nickname because he came across a Methodist book, after the books of Thessalus the First were burnt, and he embraced this doctrine. He claimed that there is no art but that of the Methodists, and theirs was the only proper way of practicing medicine. He wanted to confuse people and turn them away from Dogmatists and Empiricists. He composed many works based on that Methodist book that kept on circulating among physicians – both well and badly received – until Galen became prominent and rebuked and discredited them, burning all the Methodist books that he found and abolishing this School.

                                    Among his people, Dioscorides’ name was Pedanius, which in their language means ‘he who departs from us’. He was given this name (says Ḥunayn) because he lived isolated from his community in the mountains and in regions rich in vegetation. He stayed there at all times, and would never return to his town: not out of obedience, nor to give advice, nor to pass judgement, and this is why he received this name. As for

                            This work of Dioscorides consisted originally of five books; two other books were added later: the sixth one, which has been attributed to him, deals with venoms; the seventh discusses the aims of the [other] parts of his work.

                            The first of the [original five] books centers on drugs with perfumed smells, spices, oils, resins, and large trees. The second one deals with animals, aquatic life, seeds, pulse, edible and pungent legumes, and bitter drugs. The third book discusses the stems of plants, thorny plants, seeds, resins, and flowering plants. The fourth one deals with drugs which, for the most part, come from cold plants; it also discusses plants that are warm and have laxative and emetic properties, and, at the end of this section, venomous plants that have beneficial properties. The fifth book deals with grapevines, different kinds of potions, and drugs of mineral origin.

                                    The most distinguished philosophers among the Greeks were five; the first one in chronological order was Empedocles, followed by Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle son of Nicomachus.

                                    Empedocles was the first one who sought to harmonize the meanings of the divine attributes, showing that all of them referred to one single notion, and that, even though [God] is described as ‘knowledge’, ‘goodness’, or ‘omnipotence’, He is not made up of distinct attributes, but only referred to by all these different names. He is in truth One and nothing can be added to His uniqueness, contrary to the other created beings. That which is singular in the world is susceptible to becoming a plurality by virtue of its parts, its meanings, or its similarities; but the essence of the Creator is beyond all that [i.e. indivisible].

                                    Pythagoras lived sometime after Empedocles. He left Syria for Egypt to learn from Solomon, the son of David.

                                            The extant Greek passages of Porphyry do not mention Solomon and David. The alignment of Jewish-Christian chronography with the heroes of pagan learning (Pythagoras to Plato) in Christian apologist writing begins in the 2nd cent.

                                    When he learned geometry with the Egyptians he went back to Greece, where he introduced the study of this discipline along with natural philosophy and religion. With no other help than his own intellect, Pythagoras deduced the science of melodies and musical composition, and their relationship with arithmetical proportions. He claimed that he had received this knowledge from the light of prophecy,

His ideas concerning numbers were close to those of Empedocles, who claimed that above the natural world there was a spiritual one made of light, the beauty and splendour of which cannot be comprehended by reason, but only by the pure soul that longs for this knowledge. Pythagoras held that the best way for a man to raise his soul is to relinquish vanity, abusive power, hypocrisy, envy, and any other material desire; once freed from them, the soul will be worthy of entering the spiritual world and reach the essential divine knowledge that it covets. [He believed that] the pleasures longed for by the soul come by themselves without restriction, such as the melodies that are perceived through the sense of hearing, without any need to seek them. Pythagoras composed notable works on arithmetic, music and other disciplines – these are Ṣāʿid’s words.

                            Pythagoras preserved the health of the healthy and healed both the bodies of the sick and their tormented souls, sometimes with supplications, sometimes with divine melodies with which he alleviated the pains of the body. He commanded the protection of all bonds, not only deposits, but also true words deposited with us and sincerity in promises.

                                    Pythagoras used to convey his knowledge using symbolic language to keep it secret. Examples of his use of riddles are: ‘Do not step over the balance’, meaning: ‘Avoid excess’; and: ‘Do not stir the fire with a knife, if it is already hot’. This meant: ‘Do not use offensive words when someone is already angered’. And: ‘Do not sit on a bushel’

Pythagoras’ father, who was expelled with them, lived by a lake before travelling to Samos seeking to make a living. Once settled in Samos, he became an honoured man. He once travelled to Italy with his son Pythagoras for pleasure, because it was a very fine place to visit and extremely fertile, and it is said that Pythagoras returned to live there owing to the good impression left by that first visit.

                                    The governor of Samos, Androcles, took Pythagoras under his care and supported him because he was the youngest of all siblings. From an early age, he was educated in literature, language and music. When he reached adolescence, he was sent to Miletus and entrusted to Anaximander the Wise, who taught him geometry, mensuration, and astronomy. Pythagoras’ love for learning and philosophy increased after he mastered these two disciplines.

In view of the aggravation of his condition and the situation at his home, his students took him to Ephesus; and when his illness became more serious, they besought the Ephesians to give their permission to transfer him from the city. Pherecydes was then taken to Magnesia, where he was nursed until his death. He was buried there and his story written on his grave.

Pythagoras was assigned demanding tasks, different from those carried out among the Greeks, in the hope that he would not accept them and thus they could disapprove him and turn down his petition but, to their great amazement, he accepted and performed these tasks diligently. News about his piety spread all over Egypt and reached king Amasis, who put Pythagoras in charge of sacrificing animals to God and of the rest of their religious offerings too, a responsibility that had never been entrusted to any foreigner.

When the people of that city met Pythagoras and saw his pleasant appearance, his eloquence, nobility, and breadth of knowledge, the virtue with which he conducted his life despite his great fortune, and the perfection and wealth of all his qualities, they yielded themselves to his intellectual leadership. He compelled them to protect their elders,

                                    Pythagoras had a daughter who settled in Croton; she instructed the virgins of the city in the religious laws and duties, and the precepts concerning what was lawful or unlawful. His wife also used to instruct the other women. When he died, the devout Demetrius took care of the wise man’s house and turned it into a temple for the people of Croton.

He gathered them in the house of someone called Milon and while they were there, a man from Croton named Cylon entered without permission. He was a man of noble rank and enormous wealth and very arrogant about it, insolent towards the people, and inclined to injustice. He accosted Pythagoras and began to praise himself, but Pythagoras rejected him in front of all the others and admonished him to work for the salvation of his soul.

When they attacked them, forty of Pythagoras’ companions were killed. The rest of them fled, some were seized and killed, some were able to escape and remained in hiding while the calumnies and persecution continued. Since they feared for the life of Pythagoras, a group among them was selected and they did all in their power to slip Pythagoras out of that town during the night.

When the calumnies against Pythagoras reached the ears of the people of that city, the elders of the town went to see him and told him, ‘O Pythagoras, for what we have seen, you are a wise man; but the calumnies cast against you are extremely grave.

Then he moved to Metapontum but disturbances due to his presence were so frequent that this period was remembered by the people of this town for many years. Then he fled to the Temple of

                                    Pythagoras and his friends found protection there and stayed in the temple forty days. They were not forced to flee, but the temple was set on fire. When the friends of Pythagoras noticed, they ran to him, surrounded Pythagoras and kept him in the middle of the group so that their own bodies would protect him against the fire. As the fire spread in the temple and its flames grew, Pythagoras was seized by the pains of the burning heat and fell dead. The catastrophe affected the whole group and every single one of them perished in the fire. Such was the cause of Pythagoras’ death.

The inscription on his ring stone read: ‘Evil that does not last is better than good that does not last’, which means that it is better to expect the end of evil than to expect the end of good. One of his most eloquent sayings states that, ‘Silence delivers from regret’.

                                    Socrates was one of the students of Pythagoras. In philosophy, he focused on metaphysics.

                                    He shunned and rejected material pleasures, and spoke openly against the Greek custom of worshipping idols. When he disputed with their leaders, Socrates used clear arguments and proofs, but they roused the masses against him and compelled their ruler to kill him. The king had him imprisoned and ordered that he be given poison to appease the people and keep himself safe from the threat [of the populace]; this happened after discussions [between Socrates and] the king, which have been preserved. Socrates left behind noble counsels, excellent moral instruction, famous wise sayings, and doctrines on the divine attributes that are similar to those of Pythagoras and Empedocles. His opinions on the Hereafter, however, are deficient, fall beyond the boundaries of pure philosophy, and deviate from the correct doctrines.

                                    Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus, was born and raised in Athens. He lived there and left behind three sons. It was customary among them to marry the most excellent women so that their virtues would be passed on to their progeny. Socrates, however, sought to marry a stupid woman whose impudence had no parallel in that town; and so, by habituating himself to her stupidity and patiently bearing with her bad nature, he was able to endure the ignorance of both commoners and elites.

                                <p>Socrates’ unmeasured reverence for wisdom hurt those who sought knowledge after him because he considered it too noble to be confided to leaves and scrolls. Thus his saying, ‘Knowledge is something pure and holy, not corrupt or vile; we ought not to write it down, but to treasure it in our living souls, away from the skins of dead animals, and protected from the hearts of the insolent’. He never wrote a single book nor did he dictate anything for his pupils to record in a notebook.</p>

                                    Rather, Socrates instructed them orally, as he had learned from his teacher Timotheus.

                                    When he once asked as a young boy, ‘Why don’t you let me write down the wisdom I am hearing from you?’; Timotheus replied, ‘How can you trust in the skins of dead animals and reject the thoughts of living minds? Imagine that a man meets you in the street and poses a question to you. Would it be proper for you to return to your home with him in order to look for the answer in your books? That would not be right – so exercise your memory’. And Socrates applied himself to this. Socrates abstained from worldly things, which he held in little regard. It was customary for the Greek kings to take wise counsellors with them when going into battle. On one occasion, the king took Socrates with him when he travelled to attend some business of his. In the army camp, Socrates found protection from the cold in a broken amphora, where he accommodated himself. When the sun was up, he would come out and sit on top of the amphora to enjoy the sun’s warmth, and this is why he is called ‘Socrates of the barrel’.

                                    On one occasion when the king walked past and found him inside the amphora, he stopped in front of him and said, ‘Why do we not see you, Socrates? Why are you avoiding us?’ And he replied, ‘I am busy, O King’. ‘With what?’ asked the king. Socrates replied, ‘With that which sustains life’. To which the king said, ‘Then come with us, and you will always find [this sustenance] at your disposal!’ And he said, ‘If I knew, O King, that this is what I would find with you, I would not refrain from taking it’. The king said, ‘As I have heard, you claim that worshipping idols is wrong’. Socrates replied, ‘I said no such thing’. The king asked, ‘What did you say then?’ And Socrates replied, ‘I only said that worshipping idols is useful for the king but harmful to Socrates. For this worship serves the king to foster the welfare of his subjects and exact his taxes, but Socrates knows that idols would not do any good or harm to him, for he believes in a creator who sustains him, and who will requite his bad and good deeds’.

                                            The meaning of this answer to the king is clearer in a version of this anecdote transmitted by al-Kindī, in which Socrates states, ‘Because he who truly knows God, and [who knows] what satisfies Him, needs nothing to deter him from doing evil and to frighten him from it, and that is accomplished through his commitment to duties. Others need the fear of invented idols to deter them from evil’; see Alon,

                                <p>The king asked, ‘Is there anything you need then?’ And Socrates answered, ‘Yes, take the reins of your mounts and turn them away from me, because your soldiers are obstructing the light of sun’.</p>

But Socrates said, ‘O King, you promised to give me that which sustains life, but you brought instead things that will sustain death. Socrates has no need of stones from the earth, dry fibres of plants, or spittle of worms. That which Socrates needs is always with him wherever he goes’.</p>

He commanded them to worship the Only God, the Eternal, the Maker and Creator of the world and all that is in it, to worship the Wise and Almighty rather than a sculpted stone that does not speak or hear or have any way of perceiving. He encouraged the people to be pious and righteous, he compelled them to do good and forbade them to engage in indecent and unlawful acts, because he trusted his contemporaries. But he did not seek to correct the way they conducted themselves completely, because he knew that they would not accept that from him.</p>

                                    The reason is that the ship sent every year to the Temple of Apollo with customary offerings was detained due to strong winds. It was delayed several months, and it was a custom amongst them not to shed blood or cause death by any other method before the return to Athens of the ship sent to the temple. During that time Socrates received in prison the visits of his friends. On one of these visits, Crito, who was one of Socrates’ friends, said, ‘The ship will arrive tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. We are not sparing any effort, and will pay some people to take you out of prison secretly; then, we will go all together to Rome and will settle there where they cannot reach you’. Socrates replied, ‘You are aware that I do not even possess four hundred dirhams’. Crito said, ‘I did not say you had to pay; we know that you cannot afford what they have asked us to pay, but our money will cover that and further expenses. Helping to rescue you and end your suffering brings joy to our souls’.
                                </p>
                                <p>But Socrates argued, ‘O Crito, this town, which treats me in this way, is nonetheless my town and the town of my kin. You know the reason for my imprisonment here, and I am due to be executed. This penalty was not imposed upon me for something that deserves it, but rather for opposing injustice, contesting tyrannical acts, and speaking out against those who offend God by worshipping idols instead of Him, may He be exalted. Among them, this brought me the death penalty, but these ideas would go with me wherever I go. I will never give up fighting for the truth and denouncing falseness and those advocating it, wherever I am, and the people of Rome are even less pious in my eyes than the people of my own city. Since I would seek the truth and fight for it wherever I am, I would not be safe there either but rather in the same state in which I find myself now’.</p>
                                <p>Crito insisted, ‘Think of your son and your family, and the dire state in which you will leave them’. But Socrates said, ‘What they would find in Rome is no different, except that you are here, and it is less likely that they suffer penury in your company’.</p>
                                <p>When the third day arrived Socrates’ pupils met him at sunrise as they used to do. The prison guard arrived and opened the door, the eleven judges arrived to meet him, stayed for a while, then left him alone and ordered the fetters to be removed from his feet. The guard came towards Socrates’ pupils and let them meet him. They greeted him and took a seat. Socrates left his bed and sat on the floor, then he extended his legs, massaged and rubbed them, saying, ‘How wondrous are the deeds of the divine providence that brings contraries together. There is rarely any pleasure that is not followed by pain, nor any pain not followed by pleasure’. This saying sparked a debate among them. Simmias and Phaedo asked something about the actions of the soul and the conversation among them continued until the topic of the soul was fully discussed with precise inquiry.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Socrates was in those moments, as was reported, in a state of joy, contentment and happiness; and they all were amazed by his sharpness, and the little importance he gave to death. Even in such a state, he did not refrain from enquiring about the truth, he did not lose his moral integrity and his soul was in the same state as when safe from death. But his disciples were downhearted and desolate on account of his impending departure. Simmias said, ‘Seeking knowledge by asking you, when in this state, is very hard for us and an affront to our friendship. But if we refrain from seeking knowledge now we will greatly regret it tomorrow, when we will not find in the world any wise man to explain what we want’. And Socrates replied, ‘O Simmias, do not refrain from asking whatever you want: your enquiry makes me happy; and there is no difference between my current state and any other, as far as my desire to seek the truth is concerned. I am going to lose friends and colleagues who are noble, praiseworthy and virtuous – and I was sincere and wholehearted when I said the words that you have just heard from me – but I am also going to meet other friends who are noble, praiseworthy and virtuous, such as Achilles, Ajax and Hercules,

                                    When the discussion on the soul was finished and they had learned what they desired, they asked him about the configuration of the universe, the movements of the spheres, and the composition of the elements. Socrates replied to all that. Then he told them many other stories about metaphysics and divine secrets, and once he had finished with that he said, ‘I think that now it is time for me to wash myself and pray while I can, lest we burden anyone with washing corpses.

                                    has already called and I am to go with Zeus; as for you, return to your families’. Then he stood up and entered the building to wash himself and pray. While waiting, they talked about the great calamity his loss would be; by losing Socrates they would lose a most excellent sage and a pious father, for his departure will leave them as orphans.

                                <p>Then Socrates went out and called for his wife and sons – an elder son and two young children. He said goodbye, bade them his last farewell and let them go. Crito asked him, ‘What do you want us to do with your family and with other matters?’ And he replied, ‘I do not ask for anything other than what I have always expected from you: strive to perfect your souls. If you do that you will have made me happy and everyone related to me as well.’ Then he remained silent for a while and so did the rest. The servant of the eleven judges came and exclaimed, ‘Socrates, I see that you are a courageous man. You should know that it is not I but the eleven judges who are the cause of your death. I am compelled to obey their orders, but you are the most excellent man that has come to this place. Drink the poison willingly, and wait patiently for the unavoidable’. Then he went away, his eyes filled with tears. Socrates said, ‘I will do that. You are not to blame’. He remained silent for a moment, turned towards Crito and said, ‘Tell the man to bring me the lethal drink’. He asked a servant to fetch the prison guard. When called he came with the poison; Socrates took it from him and drank it. As soon as they saw he had drunk the poison they broke in tears, sorrow pierced them in a way their souls had never experienced, and their weeping and crying rose. Socrates reproached and admonished them by saying, ‘We let the women go precisely to be spared this’. Seized by shame, they resolved to obey him despite the inconsolable pain caused by such loss. Socrates proceeded to walk to-and-fro for a while, then he called the servant and told him, ‘My legs are getting heavy’. The man told him to lie down and Socrates did so; then the servant began to touch his feet and to palpate them, and said, ‘Do you feel my touch?’ ‘No’ – he replied. Then he applied more pressure and asked whether he felt that. ‘No’ – he replied. Then he touched his legs and went on asking every now and then, and Socrates always replied, ‘No’. Gradually, he started to feel cold, and this cold progressed until it reached his loins. The servant said, ‘He will pass away when the cold reaches his heart’. And Crito exclaimed, ‘O master of wisdom, I see that our minds and yours are parting, so give us your last will!’. Socrates said, ‘You ought to do what I asked you before’. Socrates held Crito’s hand and took it to his cheek. ‘Let me know your wish’, said Crito, but there was no answer. Socrates’ gaze became fixed, and he said, ‘I surrender my soul to the One who receives the souls of the wise’. So he died. Crito closed his eyes and his jaws. Plato was not with them because he was sick. It is said that Socrates left behind twelve thousand disciples among his students and their students.</p>

                                    Socrates was a man of pale skin, reddish hair and blue eyes. He was large-boned, with an ugly face, and narrow shoulders. His movements were slow, but he was quick in his answers. He had a dishevelled beard and was not particularly tall. When asked he would bow his head for a moment before answering with persuasive words. He was often alone, did not eat and drink but little, and often mused about death. He travelled little but exercised his body persistently, his clothes were humble but dignified, his speech eloquent and flawless. He died by poison when he was one hundred and some years.

                            This disputation between him and the people of Athens took place shortly before his death. According to Isḥāq ibn Ḥunayn, Socrates lived almost as much as Plato, and he states that Plato lived eighty years.

                                            has its origin in Orphic myths of weaving; see Chase, ‘Der Gottheit lebendiges Kleid’.

According to the Arabic version of Aetius’ work (attributed to Plutarch in the Greek tradition), Pythagoras claimed that ‘the world was formed of five solid figures that are called mathematical; the earth stems from the cube, the fire from the pyramid, the air from the octahedron, the water from the icosahedron, and the sphere of the universe from the dodecahedron. In all these, Plato agreed with Pythagoras’; see Daiber,

                                            Plato addresses this problem in a passage of the

The Platonic solids are convex polyhedra formed by congruent regular polygons, with the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. Only five polyhedra meet these criteria: tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, hexahedron, and dodecahedron. These solids and their characteristics were well known by the ancient Greeks, and were described in detail by Euclid in the thirtieth book of the
                                            <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi>
                                            , where he states (13.18): ‘no other figure, besides the said five figures, can be constructed which is contained by equilateral and equiangular figures equal to one another’, see Heath,

                                            Plato derives the four elements of matter from the first four solids (tetrahedron/fire, octahedron/air, icosahedron/water, hexahedron/earth; cf.

                                            . 53e–55b). Since the fifth solid was already known in Plato’s time and it conflicted with his cosmological model based on four elements, he explained the existence of this fifth perfect form as follows: ‘And seeing that there still remained one other compound figure, the fifth [i.e. the dodecahedron], God used it up for the Universe as a way of decorating it’ (

                                            might have originated from a rendition of the Greek verb διαζωγραφέω, ‘paint in diverse colours’, or of a cognate expression used by Plato’s commentators to convey this meaning; likewise, mention of

                                            The metaphoric use of the term weave or fabric to refer to the cosmos is not alien to Muslim authors. Al-Maqdisī, for instance, compares the world with a

In this way Plato attained knowledge of the principles behind the creation of all forms.

                                    In their language Plato means ‘wide and broad’. Plato’s father was Ariston and all his ancestors were noble Greeks of the kin of Asclepius. His mother was an aristocratic descendant of Solon, the lawmaker. As a child, Plato studied poetry and language and excelled in these disciplines, until one day he met Socrates, who rebuked the art of poetry in a way that impressed Plato and resulted in him rejecting all that he had learnt about it.

                                            In his biography of Plato, Ibn al-Qifṭī states: ‘From an early age, Plato was inclined to poetry and learnt a fair number of poems, but when he joined the circle of Socrates he realized that he reproved poetry and poets by arguing: “Poetry is but a product of the imagination that portrays a false image of the world; seeking the truth is a more noble aim”. Then Plato forswore poetry’; see

                                    He joined Socrates and studied with him for five years until he passed away. Then Plato heard about a group of followers of Pythagoras in Egypt and travelled there to learn from them. Before his association with Socrates, Plato was inclined to the theories of Heraclitus, but after meeting him he rejected Heraclitus’ school. He used to follow Heraclitus’ teachings concerning the sensible world, Pythagoras’ opinions concerning the rational world, and Socrates’ ideas regarding ethical conduct.

                                    Then Plato returned to Athens from Egypt and founded there two centres of learning where he instructed the people. Afterwards he went to Sicily, where he encountered Dionysius, the tyrant who reigned there and subjected him to severe trials until Plato was able to escape from him and return to Athens. In Athens he lived a virtuous life and made good by helping the destitute. The Athenians wanted to entrust him with their government, but he refused because he saw that they lived according to a way of behaviour he did not consider correct and to which they were so habituated that he would have not been capable of guiding their souls. He knew that he was unable to persuade them to change and that any attempt to turn them away from their current state would result in him dying like his master Socrates, who was killed even though he did not seek to force them to make their regime perfect.

                                <p>Plato lived eighty-one years. He was a man of good morals and virtuous deeds who did plenty of good for both friends and strangers; he was measured, forbearing and patient. Plato had many students and he left two men in charge of two teaching positions: the place named ‘Academia’ in Athens was occupied by Xenocrates; and the other, named ‘Lyceum’, also in Athens, was entrusted to Aristotle.</p>

                                    Plato used to wrap his wisdom in parables and talk in riddles in such a way that its meaning was only grasped by the learned. He studied with Timaeus

He composed numerous books, the titles of fifty-six of which have come down to us, among them lengthy books composed of several sections. Plato’s works were linked in groups of fours, which were collectively devoted to a single general topic and individually focused on a specific aspect of that common theme. Each one of these groups of books was called a quartet (

                                    ), and each quartet was also linked with the previous one.

                                <p>Plato had tawny skin, an average stature, beautiful in appearance with perfect features, a beautiful beard, and little hair on his cheeks. He was silent and soft-speaking, had quick and bright eyes, a black mole at the bottom of his chin, a long arm span, and gentle speech. He was fond of empty areas, of wild places, and of solitude, and most of the time his whereabouts were revealed by the sound of his weeping, which could be heard from miles away deep in the desert and the wilderness.</p>

                            Aristotle was the son of Nicomachus of Gerasa, the Pythagorean. The name Nicomachus means ‘victorious over his adversaries’, and Aristotle means ‘of perfect virtue’. According to Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī al-Masʿūdī Nicomachus was a follower of Pythagoras and the author of a famous book on arithmetic.

                                    Aristotle was originally from a city named Stagira, in the land known as Chalcidice which borders on Thrace, close to the cities of Olynthus and Methone. The name of his mother was Phaestis. His father, Nicomachus, was the personal physician of Amyntas, the father of Philip, who was the father of king Alexander.

                                    The ancestry of Nicomachus goes back to Asclepius, the father of Machaon, who had a son named also Asclepius.

                                    Aristotle was still a young boy when Nicomachus died and was entrusted to Plato by Proxenus, his father’s executor. Some people claim that Proxenus’ decision to leave Aristotle in Plato’s custody was inspired by God in the Pythian Temple;

                                    others argue that it was rather due to his friendship with Plato. It is said that Aristotle studied with Plato for twenty years and that, when Plato travelled to Sicily for a second time, Aristotle acted as his successor in the school known as the ‘Academy’. When Plato returned from Sicily Aristotle transferred to the Lyceum where he began a school dedicated to Peripatetic philosophy. When Plato died, Aristotle joined Hermias the Slave, who was ruler of Atarneus.

The text seems to be corrupted at this point and it is possible that this might have been a transcription of the name of Hermias’ former master, Eubulus of Bithynia, whom Hermias is said to have murdered in order to become ruler of Atarneus. Hermias invited Aristotle to his court and married him to his niece, Pythias:

                                    He went back to Athens, which was known as the city of the sages, after Hermias’ death, but King Philip summoned him to Macedonia, and he lived there as a teacher until Alexander began his campaign in Asia. When Aristotle left, Callisthenes took his place in Macedonia.

                                    When Aristotle heard about it, he left Athens for his homeland in Chalcidice because he hated the thought that the Athenians would cause him as much trouble as they had for Socrates, Plato’s master, which led to his execution. Aristotle left before anyone had urged him to flee upon his receipt of the letter of the hierophant defaming him, or before he suffered any harm. Aristotle’s

                                    His desire to do good and his interest in improving the situation of the people is evident in his epistles and books, in which the reader finds abundant examples of his involvement in the relationships between the kings and their subjects in his time, and in all that could improve their wellbeing and be advantageous to them. On account of all the favours, benefits and other services that he secured for the people, the Athenians assembled and agreed to compose an inscription and engrave it on a stone pillar that was placed in the high citadel of the upper part of the city known as the acropolis.

                                    Only one Athenian named Himerius disagreed about the inscription. After the assembly of Athens had agreed upon this matter he demurred and spoke in opposition. He rushed to the pillar that the Athenians had agreed to inscribe with a eulogy and to erect in the place named the Acropolis

Later, an Athenian named Stephanus and some other people attached to a pillar a stone plaque on which they had written the same encomium of Aristotle placed in the first pillar, but adding a mention of Himerius and what he did when he threw the pillar down, and stating that he should be shunned and cursed.

                                    When Philip died, he was succeeded by Alexander, who left his country to fight other nations and conquered the lands of Asia. Aristotle decided then to adopt a life of retirement and to abandon all his relationships and dealings with kings. He went back to Athens, where he founded the aforementioned centre of learning which was dedicated to Peripatetic philosophy. He was eager to improve the lives of the people and to help the destitute and the needy, to marry the widows and provide sustenance to the orphans, whom he was committed to educating and helping, as well as anybody who wished to acquire knowledge and instruction in any kind of discipline and field. Aristotle helped them to achieve this and set them on their feet, he gave alms to the poor, brought amenities to the cities, and restored the buildings of his hometown, Stagira.

The stories written by his biographers bear testimony to that, and all the accounts on Aristotle’s life are unanimous on this matter.

                                    When Aristotle reached his eighth year, he was taken by his father to Athens, the city known as the city of the sages, and brought to the Lyceum. His father introduced him to poets, rhetoricians, and grammarians, under whom he studied for nine years. They called this teaching system ‘comprehensive’,

At that time, some scholars used to disparage the science of the rhetoricians, language teachers and grammarians and rebuked those who studied it. Epicurus and Pythagoras were among those who postulated that there is no need to engage with linguistic disciplines in order to pursue the study of any science. For them, grammarians were mere schoolteachers, poets sources of falsehood and lies, and rhetoricians people of deception, bias and disputation.

                                <p>When Aristotle became aware of this polemic he felt the need to defend and vindicate the necessary role of grammarians, rhetoricians and poets. He claimed that that no discipline can dispense with their knowledge, because articulate speech is a tool proper to their arts, and the superiority of men over beasts rests on their ability to speak. Those who most properly may be considered to be human are those with the greatest ability to speak, those most capable of expressing their own thoughts, those most able to use the right words at the right moment, and those who best choose the words to express themselves in the most concise and appealing manner. Wisdom is the most precious thing and the expression of it rests on proficiency in argument, command of idiom, concision in phraseology, freedom from imbalance and error, from badly formed argumentation, and from the ugliness of stuttering and stammering. Whenever these faults appear, the light of knowledge fades away, duty fails to be performed, needs are unsatisfied, everything becomes confusing for the listener, the meaning is corrupted, and doubts creep in.</p>
                                <p>Once Aristotle had perfected the art of the poets, grammarians and rhetoricians and had full knowledge of it, he pursued other disciplines such as ethics, politics, natural philosophy and mathematics, and metaphysics. At the age of eighteen, he joined Plato and became his student and pupil.</p>

                                    Plato would hold a session and be asked to speak; then he would say: ‘When the people arrive’. But as soon as Aristotle came he would say ‘Speak, for the people have arrived’. [Others claim that] Plato might have said instead: ‘As soon as Intellect arrives’; and when Aristotle came he would say: ‘Speak, for Intellect has come’.

Whenever a difficult philosophical question or a matter of knowledge arose, they would come to that place and sit there to debate until the matter they had found dubious and obscure was solved and explained. They hoped that, by coming to the place in which the remains of Aristotle were buried, their intellects would become sharper, their understanding sounder, and their minds subtler. But they also sought to honour him after his death, to mourn his departure and to lament their own misfortune for losing the sources of his wisdom.

                                <p>In the large city known as Palermo, in the island of Sicily, there is a big congregational mosque, a great temple that the Christians used before as their church. I heard some locals saying that the ‘Wise man of the Greeks’, i.e. Aristotle, rested in a suspended coffin inside that temple that the Muslims had turned into a mosque, and that the Christians used to revere his power and expected to be healed by it, considering the honour and reverence that he had received from the Greeks. The reason for suspending the coffin between heaven and earth was that people used to touch it when they begged to be healed, or prayed for rain or about other serious matters that required them to seek refuge in God Almighty and to turn to Him in dire and dangerous times. and because they would tread on one another. I saw there a large casket that might have belonged to that tomb.</p>

                                    Aristotle was a pale-skinned man, partly bald, of a fair stature, with large bones, small blue eyes, thick beard, aquiline nose, small mouth, and a broad chest. He used to walk fast when he was alone and slow when he was in the company of friends. He studied books constantly, he never talked drivel and he pondered about every single word. He used to bow his head in silence for a while when he had to reply a question, and his answers were laconic. During the day he used to retire to the wilderness and to walk beside rivers. He loved listening to music, and meeting mathematicians (

                                    ). He was fair-minded when he debated with opponents, and always acknowledged right and wrong. He was modest in his clothing, and moderate when eating, drinking, having sexual intercourse, and moving around. In his hand he always held an instrument to measure the stars and hours.

                                    The philosophy of the Greeks reached its zenith with Aristotle, who was the seal of their sages and the master of their scholars. He was the first who separated the art of logical demonstration from other branches of logic by representing it in its three different figures.

The particular works are the treatises that only deal with a single topic, some of the general ones are records for revising what one had learnt from one’s studies, which he wrote in seventy books for Ephorus.

                                    he enumerates the principles of all natural entities, those things like the principles, those that derive from the principles, and those that resemble the things that derive from them. The principles are matter and form; analogous to the principles – it is not a real principle but close to them – is non-existence; the entities derived from the principles are time and place; and those which resemble what derives from the principles are void, fullness, and infinite. As for the particularities of each natural entity, some of them belong to entities without existence and some to entities which have been brought into existence. The entities that have no existence are discussed in the two first books of

                                            For the art of logic and the construction of syllogisms we did not find any previous foundation to build upon but accomplished this after great effort and lengthy exertion. Even though this art has been newly discovered and invented by us, we have fortified its domain and constructed its foundations properly without failing to include the elements that are a necessary part of it, as happened in earlier disciplines. It is complete, with solid, firm bases and properly built underpinnings, sound structures, readily known aims and clear features standing before it like well-arranged pillars and sturdy buttresses. Whoever wishes to study this art in the future ought to forgive the faults that he may find in it, and treasure what he has received from our arduous efforts as a precious gift and a valuable possession, for he who has worked painstakingly merits forgiveness.

                                    The eighth book deals with the rules that define poetry, the kinds of constructed poetic utterances, and all the elements in each genre. It also lists all the things that give the art of poetry coherence, discusses the number of classes, the types of poems and poetic utterances, the modes of composition in each of them, the circumstances in which it is practised and is appropriate, and becomes most excellent, understandable, beautiful, and pleasant; and in which cases it should be used in order to be most eloquent and extraordinary.

They are rather like someone who is ignorant of foodstuffs and drugs and has no ability to separate poisons in their effects so as to identify their characteristic signs with certainty.

                                <p>The secondary goal is that each of these four arts will provide its essential features, so that someone who wants to become a skilled dialectician will be aware of what he needs to know and will be aware by what standard he can evaluate the effect of his utterances on himself and others in order to see if he is taking a dialectical approach through them. Or, if he desires to be a skilled orator, he will know what he needs to know, and by what standard he may evaluate the effect of his utterances on himself and on others, and to see if in this he is taking a rhetorical or some other kind of approach. Similarly, if he desires to be a skilled poet, he will be able to know what he needs to know, and by what standards he may evaluate the effect of the poem on himself and on others, and to see if he is following the approach of the poets or deviating from it and confusing it with some other approach. And if he wants to acquire the ability to use sophistry on others and not to be subject to it, he will know what he needs to know, and by what standard it is possible to evaluate each word and each opinion so he will see if he is using sophistry in this way or is subject to it and in what context this is happening.</p>

But if he dies without having left any will, and Theophrastus is willing to do it, I would like him to take care of these affairs in place of Nicanor and administer the inheritance of my children and my properties as Nicanor was supposed to do. In case Theophrastus is not willing to act as administrator, then the aforementioned executors of the testament should be referred to Antipater, whom they ought to consult about the administration of my inheritance, and then act in agreement.

Simon shall be given the price of a slave so that he can buy him for himself, in addition to the slave for whom he has already paid; he should also be paid the additional amount that the testamentary executors consider adequate.

                                    The assemblies of philosophers originated because the kings of the Greeks and elsewhere used to teach their children wisdom and philosophy and to instruct them in different kinds of literature. For this reason, they painted their temples

The children used to be educated in houses painted with these images. The Jewish synagogues were painted like this, and also the Christian churches and temples, and the Muslims adorned their mosques so that their hearts would find pleasure in contemplating them and their souls would reflect upon them.

                                <p>Once the sons of the kings had memorized some lessons in philosophy or literature, they used to climb the stairs [of the temple] and sit on one of the daises made of marble which was engraved with images, during festival days when the people of the kingdom used to gather in the temple after finishing prayers and the blessings. The student would then share the knowledge he had learnt, and the literature he had memorized, speaking in the midst of the people attending, and adorned with a crown and jewellery. The teacher used to be commended, honoured and treated with reverence, and the young boy lionized, and accounted wise for his great intellect and understanding. The temples were magnificently prepared, adorned with curtains, lit with lamps and candles, and censed with aromatic oils. The people were dressed up in all kinds of finery. This has continued until our time in the established practices held in the temples of the Sabians, the Zoroastrians, the Jews and the Christians; and the Muslims also have pulpits in the mosques.</p>

                                    Aristotle was then a young orphan eager to meet and enter the service of Plato. King Rufistanes had built a House of Wisdom and furnished it for his son Nitaforas, and had summoned Plato to serve there as a teacher. Nitaforas was an inconstant young man of limited intellect and poor retention; in contrast, Aristotle was remarkable for his sharp intelligence, sound understanding and expression. Plato taught Nitaforas philosophy and the arts, but what he learnt one day was forgotten the next, and then he was unable to articulate a single word. Aristotle, however, took advantage of all the teachings addressed to Nitaforas, and absorbed and learnt by heart everything he heard without Plato ever being aware of that. He learnt in secret and kept it to himself, not telling his master anything. Then a festival day arrived, the temple was festooned and Nitaforas clothed in fine and luxury clothes. King Rufistanes and the people of the kingdom were present, as were Plato and his pupil. Once the ceremonies were performed, Plato and Nitaforas walked to the place of honour reserved for teaching, which looked over the audience and the kings, but the young Nitaforas was unable to share any wisdom or to say a single word about intellectual matters, and threw himself into Plato’s arms. Plato excused himself before the people because he had not assessed his knowledge and was unaware of the level of his understanding, for he had taken for granted his wisdom and acumen.

                                <p>Then he said: ‘Community of students! Which one of you would like to stand up to share what you have learnt in place of Nitaforas?’ Aristotle stepped forward and said, ‘O master, I will’. But Plato ignored him and did not allow him to speak. When he asked his students again, Aristotle stood up again and said: ‘Teacher of Wisdom, I will show the knowledge that I have learnt from the things you taught Nitaforas’. And Plato said to him: ‘Come up then!’ Aristotle rose to the stand without any preparation and wearing his humble and vulgar clothes, and he spoke like a singing bird about all the kinds of wisdom and arts that he had heard from Plato while he was teaching Nitaforas, without omitting a single word.</p>
                                <p>Then Plato said: ‘O king, this is exactly what I had taught Nitaforas, and Aristotle has grabbed it like a thief and memorized it secretly, without forgetting a single word. What then will be my share of rewards or my loss?’ On such days, the king would nominate his son for the kingship, honour him and elevate his rank, but on this occasion he ordered the adoption of Aristotle as a member of his household, and did not appoint his son as successor. That day everybody left approving Aristotle’s gains and wondering about rewards and losses.</p>

This is what I have learnt from the wise Plato: philosophy is the chief of all sciences, while arts impregnate the minds and bear the fruits of intellect; penetrative reflection produces far-reaching ideas; moderation eases the way to your goals; love lasts in the hearts with the help of sweet words; compliance helps to accomplish matters; all-round morality improves life and brings perfect joy; silence confers a dignified appearance, but the ability to speak flawlessly elevates status and increases honour; relations depend on fairness; modesty increases love; probity improves actions; virtues invest with authority; justice subdues the enemy; forbearance grants more supporters; hearts are engaged through kindness; altruism is required by the word generous, whilst favours earn the name of honourable; friendship lasts with loyalty; virtues achieve perfection with sincerity; fine considerations are the invention of proverbs; time helps to take decisions; he who acknowledges the deficiencies of the material world deserves more; the passing of time engenders harm; the source of good health is good eating and drinking; the advent of adversities spoils life; being ungrateful for favours necessarily leads to being denied them; those prone to weariness are abandoned;

                                            <hi rend="italic">man ittaʾada</hi>

                                    will not have regrets; the impulsive person enmeshes himself; he who hastens puts himself in trouble; he who thinks carefully is safe; he who reflects collects benefits; he who asks learns; he who takes upon himself what he cannot do will be embarrassed; experience does not have an end, but the intelligent man wants more of it; everybody is governed by the force of habit; everything can be changed except nature; every harm has its remedy except death; he who is known by his wisdom is regarded with admiration.

                                <p>Conciseness is enough to show eloquence; poor understanding by the listener is only thing that damages an eloquent speaker. Whoever finds the garb of certitude will have no need to dispute when he is asked, but he who fails to attain it will succumb to ignorance, and will be lured by vain thoughts and turned away from certainty by passions, for the force of bad habit will set him apart from the virtues of learning.</p>
                                <p>Distress upon the calamities of friends is more praiseworthy than fortitude, but fortitude upon someone’s own tragedy deserves more praise than distress; nothing changes fortune faster than standing up against tyranny; he who seeks to serve the uncultured ruler is no longer safe, but doomed; it is difficult to ascend to a position of authority, but too easy to fall in disgrace.</p>

                                    Sayings of this sort were the first things that the sage would teach his student in his first year, in addition to learning to write Greek, and they subsequently proceeded to learn poetry and grammar, arithmetic, geography, astrology, medicine, music and, only after that were they promoted to the study of logic and, finally, philosophy. These are the disciplines devoted to the most elevated matters, and these ten were studied by pupils for ten years.

                                            This categorization of sciences into ten disciplines is an oddity in Arabic literature, as Ritter and Pressner pointed out in their translation of the

                                <p>When the wise Plato saw how well had Aristotle learnt the teachings and lessons addressed to Nitaforas, with such secrecy, retentiveness and natural talent, and that the king had ordered him to adopt him as a member of his household, he decided to also keep Aristotle with him as a student and to instruct him in all the ten disciplines so that he would become a wise philosopher knowledgeable in all the branches of knowledge that we have mentioned.</p>

                            <item>Know that nothing is more beneficial for people than their rulers, but only if they are righteous; there is nothing worse for them and their souls than a corrupt one, because the ruler is to his subjects as the soul is to its body, which cannot live without it.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Beware of covetousness, for your well-being and that of those with you resides in renunciation. Know that renunciation is achieved through certainty, certainty through patience, and patience through reflection. If you reflect about the material world, you will not find it possible to praise it to the detriment of the afterlife, for this world is the abode of tribulation and the home of misfortune.</item>

                            <item>If you want freedom from want, then seek it through contentment, because someone who does not possess contentment will not be made free from want by wealth, no matter how much there is.</item>

                            <item>Know that one of the signs revealing the vicissitudes of this world and the grief of the life on it is that one part of it does not prosper unless another decays, and that there is no way for people on earth to glory except by humbling others.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Know that worldly matters are sometimes gained without decisiveness or religious virtue. Now if you attain your need from it [i.e. the world], though you were aiming wrongly; or if it turns away from you, though you were aiming justly, then you must not be carried away by this and repeat the error or avoid what is right.</item>

If you need to occupy your soul with pleasures, let them be the conversation with learned men and the study of books of wisdom.</item>

                            <item>You should know that no one is free of fault or virtue. Do not let the defects of a man prevent you from requesting his help where he has no shortcomings; nor let the many virtues of a man persuade you to ask for his help when it comes to something for which he has no means to help. But be also aware that too much help from the wicked will be more harmful for you than lack of help from the good.</item>

                            <item>Justice is God’s scale on earth, may He be exalted; with it He takes from the powerful to the weak, to the truthful from the false. Whoever alters the balance that God has set for His subjects in His scale behaves with the utmost ignorance and makes the most fundamental error towards Him.</item>

                            <item>I do not seek knowledge with the aspiration of reaching its furthest point, nor aiming at possessing it all. I only ask for that which cannot be ignored and that which a sensible man cannot properly contradict.</item>

                            <item>Let religion take the place of your king and he who opposes religion will be his enemy. Never reprove or abase those who uphold the law. Take lessons from those who have passed and do not be a bad example for those who are to come.</item>
