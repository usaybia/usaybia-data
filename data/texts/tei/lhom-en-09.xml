       <hi rend="bold"> 9.1 Jūrjis<note n="1" type="footnote">
         <p> This chapter is included in all three versions of the book. Biographies 9.1–9.38 of
          this chapter have clear parallels in Ibn al-Nadīm, <hi rend="italic"> Fihrist</hi>
          (Flügel, 244–245; Tajaddud, 304–306; Sayyid, 2/1:144–149). Both <hi rend="smallcaps">
           IAU</hi> and Ibn al-Nadīm seem to have relied on the same unidentified source, which, in
          view of the transliterations and the religious affiliation of the translators, must have
          been originally written by a Christian author in Syriac and later translated into Arabic.
           <hi rend="smallcaps"> IAU</hi> is more detailed than Ibn al-Nadīm. The second part of <hi
           rend="smallcaps"> IAU</hi> ’s account (9.39–9.49) centres on the sponsors of the
          translation movement and has no parallel in Ibn al-Nadīm; the main source for this list of
          patrons is Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq’s <hi rend="italic"> Epistle</hi> (<hi rend="italic">
           Risālah</hi> ). The identities of the translators mentioned in this chapter have been
          discussed in Meyerhof, ‘New Light’; Gutas, <hi rend="italic"> Greek Thought, Arabic
           Culture</hi> , 121–140; Nasrallah, <hi rend="italic"> Histoire</hi> , ii:74–91; Micheau,

      <p> The first of those who began the work of translating medical and other works from Greek
       into Arabic. Jūrjis undertook this task at the invitation of the caliph al-Manṣūr, who
       treated him with the utmost generosity. An account of his life has been given in an earlier
       chapter of this work.<note n="2" type="footnote">

      </p>
      <p> Ḥunayn knew four languages – Arabic, Syriac, Greek and Persian – including rare words as
       well as common vocabulary. His works are superb examples of the translator’s art.</p>

      <p> Isḥāq was conversant with all the languages that his father knew, and was comparable to
       him as a translator. His style was mellifluous and his diction fluent. However, Ḥunayn has
       more works to his credit, both original compositions and translations, than Isḥāq. Accounts
       of the lives of both Isḥāq and his father have been given in an earlier chapter of this
        work.<note n="4" type="footnote">

         <p> Although <hi rend="smallcaps"> IAU</hi> does not include al-Ruhāwī in the name, this
          must be Ayyūb al-Ruhāwī al-Abrash (d. ca. 220/835), otherwise known as Iyob or Job of

          Jadhīmah, but whether this meaning was applicable to Job of Edessa is unknown. He was a

          the Abbasid caliphs and the governor of Khorasan, ‘Abd Allāh ibn Ṭāhir. Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq

         <p> Ibrāhīm ibn Baks (fl. 4th/10th c.) was a Christian physician active in Baghdad, whose
          biography is given in Ch. 10.42. Ibn al-Qifṭī, who refers to him as Ibrāhīm ibn Bakkūsh

       </note> Dāwūd ibn Sarābiyūn,<note n="65" type="footnote">
        <p> Meyerhof suggests that Dāwūd ibn Sarābiyūn corresponds to the Dāwūd al-Mutaṭabbib who
         commissioned five Syriac translations of Galenic works from Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq (<hi
          rend="italic"> Risālah</hi> , 3, 6, 49; <hi rend="italic"> Galen Translations</hi> , 9,
         13, 121); see also Meyerhof, ‘New Light’, 719. Ḥunayn states that Dāwūd was in his thirties
         when he translated Galen’s <hi rend="italic"> On the Medical Art</hi> (Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq,
          <hi rend="italic"> Risālah</hi> , 6; <hi rend="italic"> Galen Translations</hi> , 13).
         According to Ibn al-Qifṭī, Dāwūd, a native of Beth Garmai, was one of the court physicians
         under al-Hādī (r. 159–170/775–786) and the brother of Yūḥannā ibn Sarābiyūn, the author of
         the <hi rend="italic"> Pandectae</hi> (<hi rend="italic"> al-Kunnāsh</hi> ) (Ibn al-Qifṭī,
          <hi rend="italic"> Taʾrīkh al-ḥukamāʾ</hi> , 431). Ullmann, who has questioned the dating
         of this work in view of the various quotations from authors who lived in the second half of
         the 3rd/9th century, argues that the publication of Ibn Sarābiyūn’s <hi rend="italic">
          Kunnāsh</hi> should be dated at the end of that century, and that Dāwūd and Yūḥannā were
         separated by a century (Ullmann, ‘Yūḥannā ibn Sarābiyūn’, 280). <hi rend="smallcaps">
          IAU</hi> also refers to Dāwūd ibn Sarābiyūn as the brother of Yūḥannā and mentions him
         elsewhere several times, often in connection with the Bukhtīshūʿ family (Chs. 8.2; 8.3; and
         8.25); he states that Abū l-Ḥasan ibn Nafīs, teacher of Ibn Baks, commissioned the
         translation of Ibn Sarābiyūn’s <hi rend="italic"> al-Kunnāsh al-ṣaghīr</hi> in the year
