                                            is confused. Pingree interpreted it as a proof that Abū Maʿshar wrote a piece of fictional, astrological history (‘Abū Maʿshar’s astrological history must have been hilariously inaccurate’; see
                                            <hi rend="italic">Thousands</hi>
                                            , 18 n. 3). Van Bladel argues, on the contrary, that the reference to the length of rule of Julius Caesar proves that Abū Maʿshar’s source was a chronicle and that the author was trying to establish a historical basis for his astronomical theories (
                                            <hi rend="italic">The Arabic Hermes</hi>
                                            , 152). The reference to the Argives is key here, for they and their early kings are part of the scenery of the Christian chronical tradition on which later sources depended. But the reference to Julius Caesar and the period of 18 years for his rule has no historical basis. Neither Pingree nor Van Bladel discuss the possibility of a misinterpretation or a scribal mistake. Owing to the similarity of

                                            , an alternative explanation would be that the name was based on that of the hero Ἴων turned into Arabic *

                                    The origin of the name Asclepius is uncertain. Ancient etymologies concentrate on the second element, deriving it from the word

                            the Temple of Asclepius was a shrine in the city of Rome in which there was an image that answered questions put to it by petitioners. The image was reputed to have been the work of Asclepius at some time in remote antiquity. The pagans of Rome held that the fashioning of the image had been determined by the motions of the stars, and that the spirit of one of the seven planets dwelt within it. Christianity had preceded star-worship in ancient Rome. Thus far Orosius.

                            In addition, there are numerous passages in the works of Galen in which he states that the art of medicine as practised by Asclepius was divine in nature. ‘It was as far superior to our own medicine,’ he says, ‘as ours is to that of the remedies you find in the streets’.

                            that God, exalted is He, intimated to him in person that it was more fitting to call him an angel than a man. Hippocrates tells us that when God, exalted is He, took Asclepius to Himself, He caused him to ascend into the air in a shaft of light.

                            Other authorities have asserted that Asclepius enjoyed such esteem among the Greeks that people afflicted with illness would visit his grave in the hope of being restored to health. Some have claimed that on his grave a thousand lamps were lighted nightly. There were kings among his posterity, and he has sometimes been ranked among the prophets.

                                    is a Ps-Platonic work focused on the relationship between knowledge and prophecy (see Pines, ‘On the Pseudo-Platonic Quotation’). There are, however, four other works that bore the Arabic title

                                    , or versions of it. Three of these treatises are directly related to the Platonic corpus: (1) the actual

                                    written by Plato and translated by Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq (and maybe also by Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī), and of which only some quotations in Arabic have come down to us. (2) Galen’s epitome of Plato’s

                                    . (3) al-Fārābī’s synopsis of Plato’s

                            Among other things, he asserts that Asclepius spoke about things of the invisible world and issued amazing prophecies with the aid of divine inspiration; moreover, the people saw those prophecies come to pass just as he had said. Plato also states, in the third book of
                            <hi rend="italic">The Republic</hi>
                            , that Asclepius and his sons were knowledgeable about the art of government, and that his sons were stout in battle and skilled in the art of medicine. He adds that Asclepius was willing to treat anyone with an ailment that could be cured. In a case of a fatal disorder, however, he would not prolong a life that was of no use either to the patient himself or to others; in a word, Asclepius would not treat such a patient.

                                    Hermes, peace be upon him, had a dark complexion. He was tall, bald, handsome, thick-bearded, a well-made man, with long arms and broad shoulders; he was heavy-boned, carrying no spare flesh, and had flashing black eyes. His speech was slow and infrequent. He was controlled in his movements, and tended to look at the ground when he walked. He was often pensive. At the same time, he could be short-tempered, with a frowning demeanour, and would shake his forefinger when talking.

These are the three blessings that were united in him, and in him alone; the annals of history afford no other example. Moreover, God took him to Himself in a shaft of light. However, the Ḥarrānians allege that he was carried upward in a fire sent by God, and it is for that reason that they cremate their dead. Indeed, some of them consent to be burned before death, the sooner to draw near to God, and as an act of piety”.’ On God’s summons of Asclepius in a shaft of light, see Ibn al-Qifṭī

It was his grandfather Gayōmart (that is, Adam) who taught him the hours of night and day. Furthermore, this Hermes was the first to build temples to the glory of God, and he was also the first to investigate and discuss the art of medicine. For the benefit of his countrymen, he composed numerous books, in metre and rhyme and written in their own language,

Wishing to ensure that knowledge of the various sciences would survive, he also carved descriptions of them on the walls of these temples for the benefit of those who would come after him, for he was afraid that otherwise that knowledge might be forever lost from the earth. According to the traditional account which has come down to us from our forebears, Idrīs was the first to peruse books and investigate various fields of learning, and God sent down thirty sheets to him. He was the first to sew and wear clothing. God raised him to a lofty station.

                                    Hermes the Second possessed great knowledge of the sciences of medicine and philosophy and understood the workings of numbers. Pythagoras the arithmetician was a pupil of his. This Hermes restored the sciences of medicine, philosophy and numbers in Babylon, after the city had been swept bare of them by the Flood. Babylon, the capital of the Chaldaeans, was the city of philosophers from the east. They were the first to establish penalties and codify laws.

He was knowledgeable about lethal drugs and harmful animals: he composed a work devoted exclusively to venomous animals. He liked to travel in the various regions of the country, and he came to know his way around the various cities and became familiar with their features, as well as the natures of the people who lived there. He is the author of a number of excellent aphorisms on the art of alchemy, and they are also relevant for many other arts, such as glassblowing, the piercing of beads, ceramics, and the like. Hermes the Third had a pupil named Asclepius, who lived in the land of Syria.</p>

                            Returning now to the subject of Asclepius: he is said to have been able to cure patients who had been despaired of. So impressive were his feats that the people came to think that he could raise the dead. He was celebrated in the works of the Greek poets, who asserted confidently that he could restore the dead to life, bringing any person who had died back to the world of the living.

                            states that Asclepius’ life lasted for ninety years, fifty as a youth and before the divine power was disclosed to him, while the final forty were devoted to learning and teaching. He was survived by two sons, both of whom were expert in the art of medicine. He forbade them to teach medicine to anyone apart from their own offspring and other relatives; they were not to initiate any outsider into that art. His successors were to be subject to the same restrictions. Specifically, he left instructions that they were to go to live in the midst of the populated regions of the land of the Greeks (by which he meant three islands, one of them being Kos, the island where Hippocrates was born), and furthermore they were not to reveal knowledge of the art of medicine to outsiders, but rather, fathers should teach it to their sons. Both Asclepius’ sons were with Agamemnon when he sailed to conquer Troy.

                                    It is said that there were pupils of Asclepius in every region of the world, numbering twelve thousand in all, and that Asclepius taught the art of medicine exclusively through the spoken word, and that men of his line inherited their knowledge of it through successive generations, down to the time of Hippocrates, until degeneration set in. Hippocrates perceived that his family and clan had become reduced in numbers, and there could be no certainty that that knowledge would not be lost forever. Accordingly, he began to set it down in written form, concisely expressed.

                                    There are two traditional accounts of the life of Asclepius, one allegorical and the other literal. According to the former, Asclepius was one of the powers of God, blessed and exalted is He, and he was given the name Asclepius because of the action of that power, which was the prevention of dryness.

                                <p>(Ḥunayn) An individual dies only when there is a preponderance of dryness and cold, for it is those two factors that desiccate the mortal body. It is for that reason that the art which preserves the heat and moisture of human bodies, and thereby enables them to continue to live, has a name indicating an absence of dryness.</p>

                                    (Galen) It is said that Asclepius was the son of Apollo and the son of Phlegyas and of Coronis his bride,

                                            , which ought to be Coronis (Κορωνίς), who in Greek mythology was the mother of Asclepius by the god Apollo. Her father was Phlegyas (Φλεγύας), king of the Lapiths. (Asclepius’ mother’s name was also given as Aeglē, above, n. 12, and other names; see Roscher,

                                            s.vv. ‘Askelpios’ and ‘Koronis’). The word in the text after Coronis is not easy to interpret. We adopt Müller’s ‘stopgap’ (cf. ‘Lesarten’) reading of
                                            <hi rend="italic">mahdiyyathu</hi>
                                            , meaning ‘one guided by’, specifically with reference to a newly wedded woman, i.e. Coronis as the lover of Apollo. Rosenthal suggested pointing the

                                            , referring to Phlegyas and Coronis and meaning ‘his two improvers’ (= foster-parents), but was quick to dismiss the idea. Building on this and on the reading of
                                            <hi rend="smallcaps">MS</hi>

                                            , we might suggest a form meaning ‘those who calm him’ (and perhaps again something like foster-parents). A further explanation would entail reading not Coronis but the name of the Greek god Cronos (Κρόνος, the Roman Saturn). This could help explain the fact that Asclepius is said to be the son of Phlegyas as well as Apollo (cf. again in text below). If Asclepius is ‘a compound of mortal and immortal’, there may be an attempt to dignify him as a saviour deity recalling Jesus (for the continuing importance of his cult in later antiquity, see e.g. Trombley,

No other attempts to translate Coronis into the universalizing Cronos are known and this interpretation depends on the veracity of al-Bīrūnī’s record of the commentary; it is quite possible of course that it was he who equated the

                                            with the Greek god Κρόνος, and he might also have introduced the notion of a ‘trinity’.

                                    and that he was a compound of mortal and immortal. According to that view, he was concerned for humanity because he was himself human, while at the same time he had a nature that was immortal and thus superior to that of ordinary human beings. According to the poet, the name ‘Asclepius’ is ascribed to him solely because of his medical exploits.

                                    (Galen) We shall now turn to a discussion of pictorial representations of Asclepius, his manner of dressing, and his influence. The written accounts that have come down to us, according to which he was transfigured into a god, are not factual, but are mere fanciful inventions. As is well known, he was taken up to the angels in a column of fire, like Dionysus,

                                    Heracles and other dedicated benefactors of the human race of whom legend tells us. To put the matter briefly, we may say that God, blessed and exalted is He, took Asclepius (like the others) to Himself in this fashion to destroy his mortal or earthly part by fire and then attracting to himself his immortal part and to transport his soul up to heaven.

                                    (Ḥunayn) Galen’s purpose in this passage is to show us how man can become assimilated to God, blessed and exalted is He.

                                    By extirpating his base corporeal impulses (those are what Galen means by the expression ‘his mortal or earthly part’) through the fire of discipline and self-denial and bedecking his rational soul with meritorious actions after having overcome those impulses (that is what he means by being ‘transported up to heaven’), man becomes similar to God, blessed and exalted is He.

                                <p>(Galen) As far as pictorial representations of him are concerned, Asclepius was shown as bearded, and his appearance was enhanced by the presence of a thick fringe of hair covering the front part of his head.</p>
                                <p>There is some doubt about the reason why statues of him show him as being bearded, whereas statues of his father represent a clean-shaven figure.

                                <p>A second explanation that has been offered is that Asclepius’ art was one for which modesty and maturity were essential, while a third is that his skill in the art of medicine was such that he had become greater than his father.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Contemplating one of these statues, you will see Asclepius standing with his garments tucked up, as if to show that every that every physician must always be a philosopher.

                                    (Galen) Asclepius’ staff is crooked and branched to denote the several disciplines and subdivisions found within the art of medicine. Moreover, the sculptors of antiquity did not leave the staff bare of decoration and ornamentation: they carved upon it the shape of an animal noted for its longevity, namely a serpent, twining about it. The serpent is a creature that has a number of affinities with Asclepius: its vision is keen, and it is constantly awake, never sleeping for an instant. Now, he who pursues the study of the art of medicine should not allow himself to be distracted from his goal by falling asleep; he must be incessantly alert if he is to advance in his studies and thus be in a position to identify an existing condition and announce what is likely to befall. You will find that Hippocrates says as much.

                                    Statues of Asclepius show him with a crown upon his head, made of leaves of the laurel tree, and the reason for that is that the laurel dispels sorrow. Hermes, too, in his persona of ‘the venerable’

                                    wears just such a crown. It is the function of physicians to dispel sorrow, and it is for that reason that Asclepius is represented wearing a sorrow-dispelling crown.

                                <p>Alternatively, the reason may have been that since both the art of medicine and the art of divination were symbolized by a laurel wreath, it seemed appropriate for both physicians and soothsayers to wear one.</p>

                                    Yet another possible explanation may be that the laurel tree possesses curative properties. By way of illustration, you find that wherever one is planted, any venomous creatures that may have infested the site will soon go elsewhere (the laurel tree is similar to the plant named

                                    Besides the likeness of the serpent, the sculptors of antiquity put an egg in Asclepius’ hand.

                                <p>It may be appropriate at this point to discuss, in addition, the animals that are killed in Asclepius’ name as sacrifices to achieve closeness to God, blessed and exalted is He. It appears that no-one has ever offered up a goat for that purpose, because goat hair is harder to spin than wool, and because frequent consumption of goat meat may cause epilepsy, as poor chyme is generated from it. Moreover, it has a desiccant effect, is coarse in texture and acrid upon the palate, and fosters melancholic blood.</p>

                                    We find that what are usually sacrificed to God, blessed and exalted is He, are cocks rather than goats. Indeed, there is a tradition that the divine Socrates did precisely that,

                                <p>(Ḥunayn) The expression ‘the invention of Dionysus’ refers to wine. According to the Greek tradition, Dionysus was the first to press wine from grapes, and the poets use his name to allude, not only to the power that alters the juice in grapes in preparation for its conversion into wine, but also to the happiness that is generated from the drinking of the wine.</p>
                                <p>The ‘invention of Demeter’ means bread and the grains that are used to prepare it. Thus we find that her name is used to denote cereals, and the poets may use it as a metaphor for the soil in which they grow.</p>
                                <p>By the ‘invention of Asclepius’, he means health, which is the indispensable prerequisite of everything beneficial or enjoyable in life.</p>
                                <p>(Galen) I say this because the inventions of those two cannot serve any useful purpose in the absence of Asclepius’ invention.</p>

                                    The seat on which Asclepius is seated is a representation of the potent power by means of which health is obtained. As one poet has put it, it is ‘the most sublime of all powers’.

                                    Are not all such benefits useful and enjoyable only in so far as they are accompanied by health? Assuredly, health is something that is well worthy of the name of blessing, for it is unequivocally good, not something that stands somewhere between what is good and what is evil, nor a secondary good, as some philosophers, namely the Peripatetics and the Stoics,

                                    We find, for example, that a man who seeks to display valour and energy in fighting against enemies, defending his friends by repulsing their foes, will be able to do so only by means of physical strength. Similarly, one who wishes to act justly, giving others their deserts, performing all his duties, keeping the laws, and taking pains to ensure that he is correct in all his actions and the views he holds, will be unable to live up to his aspirations if he does not possess good health. Good health is even the condition of salvation,

In a word, then, anyone who alleged that he was not concerned to have good health would certainly be talking nonsense, perhaps because of some opinion that he held, or in an effort to propagate some false doctrine. At any rate, if he were truthful, he would acknowledge that health is really the greatest of benefits. Mankind thus considered that power suitable to become a seat for the originator of the art of medicine. Moreover, its name fits its nature, for in Greek the word for health is derived from a word meaning moisture,
