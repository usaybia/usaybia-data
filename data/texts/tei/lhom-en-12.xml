                                        This biography is included in all three versions of the book. There has been considerable confusion over the identity of this Kankah (or Kanakah) al-Hindī amongst early Arab historians as well as modern historians. David Pingree has convincingly argued that two and sometimes three different persons were combined together in the various preserved accounts, including this entry by
                                        <hi rend="smallcaps">IAU</hi>

                                        has combined elements from the life of the physician Mankah al-Hindī, who is alleged to have travelled from India to Iraq and to have undertaken translations, with others from that of the astrologer Kankah al-Hindī (fl. ca. 775–800) who was also supposedly at the court of Hārūn al-Rashīd and an associate of the astrologer Māshāʾ Allāh and worked more in the tradition of Sasanian astrology than Indian astrology. Yet
                                        <hi rend="smallcaps">IAU</hi>
                                        did not realize he was making this error, for he devoted a separate later entry (Ch. 12.5) to Mankah al-Hindī. Because of this conflation of two people in whatever source
                                        <hi rend="smallcaps">IAU</hi>
                                        was using, medical works have been incorrectly attributed to the astrologer Kankah al-Hindī. Eduard Sachau has also pointed out the closeness of the name Kankah with that of the ancient Indian physician Kaṅkāyana, which might also have contributed to the misidentification of this author (al-Bīrūnī,
                                        <hi rend="italic">Alberuni’s India</hi>
                                        , i:xxxii). A further confusion arose with the development of stories in the alchemical literature about a completely fictitious Kankah al-Hindī, who was a wondrous alchemist, the inventor of an Indian amulet and founder of a city full of mechanical devices.

                                    Rather than directly from Abū Maʿshar, this last sentence seems to be taken from Ṣāʿid al-Andalusī, who refers to Abū Maʿshar’s appreciation of Kankah in exactly the same words (Ṣāʿid al-Andalusī,
                                    <hi rend="italic">Ṭabaqāt</hi>
                                    (Cheikho), 14–15). Abū Maʿshar’s description of Kankah as foremost amongst scholars of India ‘in ancient times’ (

                                <p>O Prince, beware the pitfalls of time, and fear the mastery of days and the anguish of inevitable death. Know that actions earn recompense, and therefore fear the consequences of time and days, for they are uncertain. Beware then of them. Fate is unknowable. Time is inconstant: fear then its change. It may return with adversity: fear then its assault. It is swift to surprise, and there is no security against its reversal. Know that the man who does not treat himself for the sickness of misdeeds committed during the days of his life will be further than ever from recovery in that abode wherein there are no remedies. The man who in time past has subdued and abased his senses for the betterment of his soul has clearly shown his excellence and made plain his nobility of nature. He who does not control his soul, of which there is only one, will not control his senses, of which there are five, and if he does not control his senses, which are few and tractable, it will be difficult for him to control his advisors, who are numerous and formidable, and then the masses of the people in the outlying regions of the country and the distant parts of the kingdom will be very far from any control.</p>

                                <p>Hārūn al-Rashīd once fell gravely ill. He was treated by a number of physicians, but did not recover. Abū ʿAmr al-Aʿjamī said to him, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, there is a physician in India by the name of Mankah; he is a pious man in their religion and one of their philosophers. If you were to send for him, it may be that God would bring about your recovery at his hands.’ Al-Rashīd thereupon dispatched a person to bring him to Baghdad, with a gift to persuade him to undertake the journey. Mankah went to Baghdad and attended the caliph, with the result that Hārūn al-Rashīd was restored to health; he rewarded the physician handsomely and granted him a generous pension.</p>

Not a single bodily ailment did he omit; his medicine, he said, was a sovereign remedy for every one of them. ‘What is that fellow saying?’ Mankah asked his interpreter, and the interpreter told him. Mankah smiled. ‘One way or the other, the king of the Arabs must be an ignorant man,’ he said. ‘If the matter is as this fellow said, why has he brought me from my country, separated me from my family, and incurred the expense of my keep, when he has this wonder-worker right here, under his very nose? If the matter is not as this fellow says, why does the king not have him put to death? The law permits the execution of this fellow and anyone like him, for if that is done, only one person will have died, and by his death many will have remained alive, whereas if he is allowed to live, which would be foolishness, he will kill a person a day – indeed, he will kill two, or three, or four individuals every day, as like as not, and that would be to corrupt religion and weaken the kingdom.’

                                    Abū Salamah (meaning his patron, Sallām al-Abrash) told me that the Commander of the Faithful had ordered him to go and find Jibrīl and bid him attend the caliph at the meal, as was the regular practice. He had done so, asking for the missing physician at every suite of apartments where Jibrīl was wont to attend members of the family, but had found no trace of him. Returning, he had informed the caliph of this, whereupon al-Rashīd had burst into a torrent of curses and abuse against Jibrīl. In the midst of this, in walked Jibrīl himself. ‘It would be seemlier,’ he said, ‘for the Commander of the Faithful to refrain from abusing me in this fashion and instead to weep for his cousin, Ibrāhīm ibn Ṣāliḥ’.

                                    The caliph asked him what had happened to Ibrāhīm, and Jibrīl informed him that he had left him near death, and that he would have expired by the time of the night-prayer. Al-Rashīd was greatly affected at this news: he began to weep, and ordered the tables cleared. Such was his grief that all those who were present were moved to pity for him.

                                    said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, Jibril’s medicine is Greek medicine. Ṣāliḥ ibn Bahlah al-Hindī is no less learned in the art of medicine according to the doctrines of the Indians than is Jibril in the teachings of the Greeks. If the Commander of the Faithful thinks it advisable, he could have the Indian physician brought here and sent to attend Ibrāhīm ibn Ṣāliḥ. We should then hear his opinion in the case, as we have heard that of Jibril.’ Al-Rashīd took this suggestion at once, ordering Jaʿfar to go in search of Ṣāliḥ ibn Bahlah al-Hindī, bring him to the palace, accompany him to Ibrāhīm’s sickbed, and then return with him afterward. Jaʿfar obeyed, and the physician went to Ibrāhīm’s chamber, where he saw the sick man and felt his pulse. He then returned to Jaʿfar, who asked him what he had determined, but Ṣāliḥ replied, ‘I will tell no one but the Commander of the Faithful himself.’ Jaʿfar tried his utmost to make the physician divulge the information, but he steadfastly refused, and finally Jaʿfar went to see Hārūn al-Rashīd and told him that the Indian physician had come and had seen Ibrāhīm, but was refusing to say what he had learned from his examination. ‘Show him in,’ said al-Rashīd.

                                <p>Ṣāliḥ entered and said to the caliph, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, you are the Imam and the master of judicial decisions; no ruling of yours may be overturned by any judge. I call upon you to witness, O Commander of the Faithful, and all present here, that if Ibrāhīm ibn Ṣāliḥ dies this night, or from this illness, every slave belonging to Ṣāliḥ ibn Bahlah shall be free unconditionally, every beast of burden belonging to him shall be dedicated to charitable purposes, all his property shall be distributed to the poor, and all his wives shall be trebly divorced.’ Al-Rashīd replied, ‘That was a rash promise to make, O Ṣāliḥ, in a matter that must ever be hidden from mortal man.’ ‘Not at all, O Commander of the Faithful,’ rejoined Ṣāliḥ, ‘for a matter is hidden from mortal man only if no one has knowledge of it and indications of it are lacking. I said what I said on the strength of clear knowledge and unmistakable indications.’</p>

                                    The next morning, al-Rashīd went to Ibrāhīm’s house, where the servants met him and conducted him to a chamber next to some of Ibrāhīm’s sitting-rooms. In the chamber, a carpet had been spread out on the left and another on the right, set with chairs, hassocks and cushions, while between the two carpets the floor was strewn with pillows. Al-Rashīd stood leaning on his sword and said, ‘It is not fitting, in a house of mourning, to sit with the bereaved family on anything more elaborate than mats. Take away these carpets and pillows!’ The carpets were removed by the chamberlains, and Hārūn al-Rashīd sat on the mats on the floor. This was the regular practice of the Abbasids

O God! that he should bury his cousin alive! for by God, O Commander of the Faithful, he has not died.

After he had been doing this for the sixth part of an hour, the body stirred, and then Ibrāhīm sneezed and sat up before Hārūn al-Rashīd and kissed his hand. The caliph asked him what had happened, and he answered that he had had such a sleep as he did not recall ever having had before. It had been a refreshing sleep, he said, only he had dreamed that a dog had come rushing at him, and when he had attempted to fend it off with his hand, it had bitten him on the left thumb. He had then awoken, but could still feel the pain, and he showed al-Rashīd the place where Ṣāliḥ had pricked him with the needle.
