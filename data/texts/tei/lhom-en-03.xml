                            Asclepius, as we have seen, had learned the art of medicine through practical experience

                            There were, in all, six of those sons and kinsmen who had been Asclepius’ pupils:

                                    , see Ch. 4.3.6.2. The Greek names in this chapter are notoriously difficult and our suggestions of what the form might be are offered with due caution and inevitably show inconsistencies. In many cases we have simply given in transcription the Arabic letters designating consonants or long vowels. For the main subjects of the chapter, we have chosen to vocalize (e.g. Ghūrus, Mēnas), even though these are not, as they stand, real Greek names. Where we have some confidence, we have read the Greek name or part of it in the Arabic and English. Our transcription of Greek forms follows the Classicist’s inconsistency in the marking of long vowels and in usually preferring Latinized forms (Megill
                                    <hi rend="italic">us</hi>

                            Every one of these followed the system of his master, Asclepius, namely the empirical system, and put it to practical use, for it was through practical experience that Asclepius had come to understand the art of medicine. In that way, the art was transmitted by those pupils to their kinsmen, down to the time of Ghūrus.

The sources amalgamated Philoponus with a medical John, to whom they attributed commentaries on Galen and a medical chronology (perhaps by a third John), which is preserved through a work of Isḥāq ibn Ḥunayn. The work is preserved in part independently (ed. Rosenthal) and partially in the

They held that while sense and experience were undoubtedly the principle of all the sciences and arts, they must be subject to the instruments of thought. The rules of medicine, and of the other arts, must be derived through logic and unknown things determined through things that were known.

                            Parmenides lived to the age of forty. His time as a child and a student occupied his first twenty-five years, while during the remaining fifteen years he was an accomplished man of learning and teacher. A period of seven hundred and fifteen years intervened between the date of Mēnas’ death and the birth of Parmenides. During that time, a number of physicians of note flourished, including

                            Parmenides held that the empirical method was erroneous, whether applied alone or in conjunction with analogy. Accordingly, he abandoned the empirical method and relied exclusively on analogy. At his death, Parmenides left three pupils: Thessalus, Acron, and Diocles.

                            Plato considered their pronouncements and concluded that the Empiricist system, used alone, was deficient and hazardous, while the Dogmatic system, used alone, was unreliable. Accordingly, he advocated the use of both systems simultaneously.

                        <p>Asclepius the Second lived to the age of one hundred and ten. His time as a child and a student occupied his first fifteen years, while during the remaining ninety-five years he was an accomplished man of learning and teacher, although for five years of that time he was paralysed. A period of one thousand, four hundred and twenty years intervened between the date of Plato’s death and the birth of Asclepius the Second.</p>

                            Asclepius the Second, having subjected the reasoning of the ancients to critical scrutiny, decided that Plato’s doctrine was correct and should be followed. At his death, Asclepius the Second left three pupils, all of them members of his own family, with no outsiders among them. They were the only physicians of the age, and their names were Hippocrates, son of Heracleides,

                            No more than a few months after the death of Asclepius, Macarius died in his turn, followed shortly after by

                        <p>Consequently, Hippocrates remained as the only physician of his time. His virtues were such that his name became a byword for the ideal physician and philosopher. Ultimately, he was even revered as an object of worship. He it was who strengthened Dogmatism and Empiricism to such a remarkable extent that they could not be demolished or destroyed by any adversary. Moreover, he taught outsiders the art of medicine on the same footing as his own offspring. This he did because he was afraid that otherwise the art of medicine might vanish and be forever lost to the world. This is a matter that we shall consider in the next chapter.</p>
