The accounts of al-Harīth ibn Kaladah were elaborated over time to the point where they include conflicting elements that make it difficult to assess the historical figure. He is said to have studied medicine at Gondēshāpūr in Persia, to have held learned discussions with the Persian ruler Khusraw Anūshirwān (d. 579) and to have been consulted during the final illnesses of the last two of the Orthodox caliphs nearly a hundred years later.

Partly there in Persia, and partly in Yemen, he learned the art of playing the lute as well.

                        <p>While he was in Persia he practised as a physician. The people there relied on him, and he became known far and wide among them as a man of great skill and learning. Once, when he had successfully treated a prominent dignitary, the grateful patient gave him money and a slave-girl whom al-Ḥārith named Sumayyah. Some time thereafter, al-Ḥārith became homesick for his native land and returned to al-Ṭāʾif, where he became renowned among the Arabs for his medical skill, with patients flocking in large numbers to consult him.</p>

                            may God be pleased with him, how, when he once fell ill in Mecca, the Messenger of God, may God bless him and keep him, came to visit him and said to the attendants, ‘Send for al-Ḥārith ibn Kaladah, for he is a man who knows medicine.’ Al-Ḥārith came to see the sick man, and after examining him, he said, ‘There is nothing much wrong with him. I recommend some boiled soup with a little date paste and fenugreek in it.’ Saʿd drank the soup and soon recovered.

He could discourse eloquently on the art of medicine and other matters, as may be seen from an account of a visit that he undertook to the court of Kisrā Anūshirwān.

                                <p>‘What have the Arabs to do with doctors?’ said the king, ‘ignorant and feeble-minded as they are, and with the filthy food they eat.’</p>
                                <p>‘Majesty,’ replied al-Ḥārith, ‘if they are as you say, all the more reason why they need someone to enlighten their ignorance, straighten whatever is awry with them, tend their bodies and balance their constitutions. A rational man knows these things for himself and can identify the site of his ailment, but for the most part he avoids illness altogether by leading a well-regulated life.’</p>
                                <p>‘How do they know what it is that you are explaining to them?’ Kisrā asked, ‘for if they knew what reason is, they would not have become such a byword for ignorance.’</p>
                                <p>‘Soothe a child, and you can treat him,’ said al-Ḥārith, ‘charm a snake, and you can handle it.’</p>
                                <p>He then added, ‘Your majesty, reason is something that is apportioned by God, exalted is He, among His servants, as he apportions people’s livelihoods. Every individual obtains his particular share, or more if God grants it, and thus it is that one man may be wealthy and another destitute, one foolish and another wise, one feeble and another determined. All is in the hand of Him who is mighty and omniscient.’</p>
                                <p>Kisrā marvelled at what al-Ḥārith had said. ‘Do you consider, then,’ he enquired, ‘that the character, mores and behaviour of the Arabs are admirable in certain respects?’</p>

                                    ‘Majesty,’ answered al-Ḥārith, ‘they are generous, with daring hearts; they are eloquent in their matchless tongue; they have true lineages and noble reputations. Words fly from their mouths like arrows shot from a bow, softer than the air in springtime, sweeter than the beneficent water of the spring Salsabīl in Paradise.

                                <p>‘What is the root of medicine?’ Kisrā asked.</p>
                                <p>

                                <p>
                                    ‘And what is

                                <p>‘Keeping the lips closed,’ answered al-Ḥārith, ‘and being gentle with the hands.’</p>
                                <p>‘Well said!’ Kisrā exclaimed.</p>
                                <p>‘Now, what is the most serious of illnesses?’</p>
                                <p>‘Shovelling in more food on top of food already taken will be the ruin of any creature; it is enough to kill wild beasts in the heart of the steppe,’ said al-Ḥārith.</p>
                                <p>
                                    ‘Well said!’ cried the king, ‘and from what glowing coal

                                <p>‘Very true,’ said Kisrā.</p>
                                <p>‘What do you think of the practice of cupping?’</p>
                                <p>‘When the moon is waning,’ said al-Ḥārith, ‘on a bright, cloudless day; you should be in a good mood and your blood-vessels in repose as a result of some unexpected happiness or avoidance of care.’</p>
                                <p>‘What do you have to say about entering the bath?’ asked the king.</p>
                                <p>‘Never enter the bath when you have just eaten,’ answered al-Ḥārith, ‘and moreover, never sleep with your women while intoxicated, or rise from your bed at night while naked, or sit down to eat while angry. Avoid stress, for you will be more relaxed; eat sparingly, and you will sleep better.’</p>
                                <p>‘What is your view of remedies?’ said Kisrā.</p>
                                <p>‘Avoid taking remedies while in good health,’ replied al-Ḥārith, ‘but if some disease strikes, take something to repel it before it has taken root and grown strong. The body may be likened to the earth: care for it, and it will thrive, but if you neglect it, it will go to rack and ruin.’</p>
                                <p>‘What of wine?’ asked the king.</p>
                                <p>‘The finer the flavour, the more enjoyable,’ said al-Ḥārith, ‘the purer, the more wholesome, and the sweeter, the more stimulating to desire. Do not drink it neat, for it will leave you with a headache and bring on an array of illnesses.’</p>
                                <p>‘What kind of meat is best?’ Kisrā then enquired.</p>
                                <p>‘The flesh of a young, tender suckling lamb,’ answered al-Ḥārith. ‘Dried salt meat will kill you, and withal you should abstain from the meat of the camel and the cow.’</p>
                                <p>‘What is your opinion of fruit?’ asked Kisrā.</p>
                                <p>‘All fruits are good when they are properly ripe,’ said al-Ḥārith, ‘but do not eat them once they are past their peak of perfection and have begun to spoil. The pomegranate and the lemon are the best fruits. The rose and the violet are the best aromatic plants, and endive and lettuce are the best vegetables.’</p>
                                <p>‘What do you have to say about drinking water?’ said the king.</p>
                                <p>‘Water,’ said al-Ḥārith, ‘is life itself. It sustains the body. A reasonable amount of water is beneficial, and to drink it when thirsty is good; on the other hand, to drink water upon rising from sleep is harmful. The more wholesome it is, the better. The clearest and purest water is that which comes from great rivers, cold and limpid, unmixed with water from marshes or hills, flowing along over pebbles large and small in the downs.’</p>
                                <p>‘What of its taste?’ asked Kisrā.</p>
                                <p>‘It has no definable taste,’ was the answer, ‘only it is redolent of life.’</p>
                                <p>‘What of its colour?’ said the king.</p>
                                <p>‘Its colour is not identifiable to the eye,’ replied al-Ḥārith, ‘for it imitates the colour of whatever is holding it.’</p>
                                <p>‘Tell me,’ the king went on, ‘what is the most vital element of the human frame?’</p>
                                <p>‘The most vital element of the human frame is that part where water is drunk,’ answered al-Ḥārith, by which he meant the head.</p>

                                <p>‘What is this light that is in the eyes?’ Kisrā asked,</p>
                                <p>‘It is compounded of three things,’ al-Ḥārith replied. ‘The white consists of fat, the black [the iris] of water, and the pupil, of air.’</p>
                                <p>The king then asked him, ‘How many natural elements make up the body?’</p>
                                <p>‘The body comprises four humours,’ said al-Ḥārith: ‘black bile, which is cold and dry, yellow bile, which is hot and dry, blood, which is warm and moist, and phlegm, which is cold and moist.’</p>
                                <p>‘Why not only one?’ asked the king.</p>
                                <p>Al-Ḥārith replied, ‘If the body were created from only one natural element, it would not eat, it would not drink, it would not become ill and it would not die.’</p>
                                <p>‘What about two, then?’ inquired Kisrā, ‘what if it consisted of no more than two natural elements?’</p>
                                <p>‘Not possible,’ said al-Ḥārith, ‘as they would be opposed to each other and would perpetually struggle.’</p>
                                <p>‘Three?’ suggested Kisrā.</p>
                                <p>‘That would not be a viable arrangement,’ al-Ḥārith said, ‘with two elements concordant and one discordant. No, four humours are just right for equilibrium and support.’</p>
                                <p>The king said, ‘Now summarize “hot” and “cold” for me in a few words.’</p>
                                <p>‘Sweetness is hot,’ returned al-Ḥārith, ‘and acidity is cold; whatever is pungent is hot, and whatever is bitter is in balance, for the essence of bitterness is that it is a blend of hot and cold.’</p>
                                <p>‘What is the best treatment for the yellow bile?’ inquired the king.</p>
                                <p>‘With something cold that is also soft,’ said al-Ḥārith.</p>
                                <p>‘And the black bile?’ continued Kisrā.</p>
                                <p>‘With something hot and soft,’ al-Ḥārith said.</p>
                                <p>‘The phlegm?’ Kisrā went on.</p>
                                <p>‘With something hot and dry,’ replied al-Ḥārith.</p>
                                <p>‘What about the blood?’ asked the king.</p>
                                <p>‘Some of it should be removed when it is in excess,’ said al-Ḥārith, ‘and when it is overheated it should be chilled with remedies that are cold and dry.’</p>
                                <p>‘And wind?’ said the king.</p>
                                <p>‘Gentle enemas,’ returned the physician, ‘and warm, mild oils.’</p>
                                <p>‘You prescribe enemas, then?’ said Kisrā.</p>
                                <p>‘Yes,’ said al-Ḥārith, ‘for I have read in a book by a physician that an enema will cleanse the belly and empty it of diseases. Even so, those who take enemas may become senile and decrepit or fail to produce children if they eat foods that are known to be injurious. To prefer self-indulgence to good health is sheer folly.’</p>

                                    Kisrā enquired.

                                <p>‘Moderation in all things,’ responded the physician, ‘for overeating constricts the vital spirit and blocks up the passages through which it moves.’</p>
                                <p>‘What are your views on women and intercourse with them?’ said the king.</p>
                                <p>‘Frequent intimacy is harmful,’ al-Ḥārith replied, ‘and beware of it with an elderly woman like a worn-out waterskin, for she will drain your strength and make you ill. Her ejaculate is mortal poison, her breath sudden death; she will take everything from you but give you nothing. A young woman, on the other hand, ah! her ejaculate is sweet and fresh, her embrace coquetry and flirtatiousness, her mouth cool, her saliva sweet, her breath fragrant, her passage tight; she will enhance your strength and make you more active.’</p>
                                <p>The king then said, ‘To what women does the heart most incline, and who amongst them most gladdens the eye?’</p>
                                <p>
                                    ‘With luck,’ al-Ḥārith returned, ‘you will meet one who is tall, with a stately head, a wide brow, a high nose, black eyes, red lips, flawless cheeks, a broad bosom, a comely throat, a delicate complexion, lips like coral, eyebrows joined, firm breasts, delicate waist and feet, pale-skinned, slender, with curly hair, young and tender.

                                    and lips of carmine. She will be like a cherished egg, softer than butter, sweeter than honey, more delightful than Paradise and the abode of eternity. She will be more fragrant than the jasmine or the rose. Being near her will be a pleasure, and for the two of you to be alone together will be happiness.’

                                <p>Kisrā’s shoulders shook with laughter. ‘What are the best times for copulating with women?’ he asked.</p>
                                <p>‘Toward the end of the night, for the belly is empty, the breathing is regular, the heart is inclined to desire and the womb is warm then,’ replied al-Ḥārith, ‘but you may prefer to take her in daylight, when your eyes will admire the beauty of her face, your mouth gather the fruits of her loveliness, your ear take pleasure in the sweetness of her voice, and all your limbs be at ease because of her.’</p>
                                <p>‘Well spoken, O Arab!’ exclaimed Kisrā, ‘It is clear that you have been given knowledge and granted an abundant share of understanding and intellect,’ and he ordered that al-Ḥārith should be generously rewarded and all that he had said written down.</p>

                            ), that al-Ḥārith ibn Kaladah once saw some people out in the sun and advised them to go into the shade. ‘The sun,’ he said, ‘will wear out your clothing, take away its fragrance, cause the colour to fade, and may cause some disease that is now dormant to flare up.’

                        <p>Various aphorisms are attributed to al-Ḥārith. He is reported to have said, ‘Overeating is a hotbed of disease, dieting is the beginning of the cure, and every body does best with its accustomed fare.’</p>

Entering the bath soon after eating will infallibly make a man fall ill. Going to the bath once in summer is better than going there ten times in winter. To eat dried salt meat at night will speed you to the grave. Sexual relations with an old woman will destroy the life of any man living.’

The elder brother, being about to set out on a journey, asked the younger to look after his wife in his absence, and the younger brother promised to do so. One day, however, by the merest chance, his glance happened to light upon her, and forthwith he was hopelessly smitten with love for her, and pined away with desire. The elder brother, when in due course he returned, sought the advice of various physicians, but none of them could say what ailed the younger brother. Finally he consulted al-Ḥārith ibn Kaladah. ‘I see a pair of clouded eyes,’ said the physician, ‘but it is not clear what is causing the trouble. I should like to try something: let us see what will happen if he has a drink of date-wine.’ The young man drank the date-wine, and when he had been affected by it, he recited the following lines:

In fact, al-Naḍr was a man of the Banū ʿAbd al-Dār. His full lineage is as follows: al-Naḍr ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Kaladah ibn ʿAlqamah ibn ʿAbd Manāf ibn ʿAbd al-Dār ibn Quṣayy.

Little did he know, unhappy man, that prophethood is the greatest calling, that true blessedness is the most potent state, that divine providence is most sublime, and that what God has decreed must inevitably come to pass. Al-Naḍr imagined that with his knowledge, his accomplishments and his philosophy he could resist prophethood, but how far below the Pleiades is the planet earth!

                        <p>Plato tells us the story of Marinus, a king of the Greeks whose power and might were celebrated by the poet Homer, along with the prosperity enjoyed by his subjects during his reign. But he was beset by misfortunes and harried by rebellions to such an extent that he finally decided to seek the advice of the philosophers of that age, who scrutinized the sources and origins of the matter, and finally said to him, ‘We have considered your situation, and we cannot see anything about you that would account for the misadventures that have befallen you. Philosophers know about the excesses and unregulated conduct that can occur, but that is only part of the story; the rest lies beyond the bounds of philosophical enquiry, in the domain of prophecy.’ King Marinus, they suggested, might find it useful to consult the prophet of the time and consider whatever he might say in juxtaposition with their own learning. ‘He does not live amid crowds and gardens,’ they added, ‘but in a remote part of a bare and waterless desert, among the poor people who live in that dusty place.’ The king asked them what sort of messengers he should send to seek out the philosopher and how they would recognize him. ‘It will be best to send mild-mannered men,’ they replied, ‘men such as are visibly temperate in their habits, speak the truth, and consider it more honourable to acknowledge that an opponent is in the right than to win an argument. Such men have a natural affinity with the prophet, and that will lead them to him.’</p>
                        <p>‘Instruct your messengers to enquire about him at his birthplace and town of origin and about his mode of life there. You will find that he takes little interest in the comforts of life. He is a seeker after truth who prefers to live in seclusion. He is honest and straightforward, of little regard in the eyes of kings. He is taken to be one who goes his own way, heedless of the usual concerns of people of his class. At first sight he might strike you as simple, but what you would be seeing in him would actually be shyness. If he discusses a matter, you have the impression that he knows everything there is to know about it, but is unclear about the source of the information. If asked about something he says, however, he will reply that he thought and uttered it while awake, yet without having reflected upon it, as though he had been between sleep and waking. If asked about an opinion of yours, he answers as though under the compulsion of some external force, not as one able to express his own view of the matter after having arrived at a conclusion about it. If your messengers locate him, not only will they find that this description of him is accurate, they will also be treated to marvels of word and deed.’</p>
                        <p>Marinus, thus advised, assembled seven messengers, augmented by the most learned philosophers he could find, and the party set off in search of the elusive prophet. Eventually they ran him to earth in a village that lay some five days’ journey distant from Marinus’ capital. The village was largely deserted, many of its people having left it in favour of life in the capital, which was altogether more convenient and pleasant, thanks to Marinus. The only remaining residents were a handful of ascetics who had renounced the struggle for gain and some elderly and chronically ill people who were no longer equal to the effort. There among them was the prophet, living in a tumbledown house, with the other village people clustered around it, for his presence was comforting to them, so that they had ceased to fret about the good fortune that their former fellow-citizens were enjoying. The villagers bade the king’s party welcome, but asked them, ‘What can have brought you to such a ruinous place as this, which surely has nothing to hold the attention of such distinguished persons as yourselves?’ ‘We have come,’ the spokesman for the messengers replied, ‘in search of this man, for we hope to join you in enjoying the benefits that he bestows. Can you tell us when he might be free to speak with us?’ The village people answered that the prophet was not busy and could see them at once, so they entered his house.</p>
                        <p>They found him hidden between a number of people who were keeping their eyes averted, such was their awe of him. When the seven messengers saw him, they were so impressed by the example of the others that they too were overcome by feelings of awe. Only the philosopher retained his composure, questioning his impressions and seeking to understand what he was seeing. The spokesman for the messengers greeted the prophet, and he returned the greeting, but in a weak voice, sounding like a man half asleep and confused. Subsequently, his drowsiness increased and his robe almost came undone. Seeing him thus overcome, the people around him averted their eyes and stood up as though praying. But then he spoke: ‘Greetings, O messengers of the sinful man who took possession of a part of my world and attempted to promote its welfare by endowing it with a plethora of material benefits and thereby flooded and ruined it. He may be compared to a man who has been entrusted with the care of part of a garden producing flowers and fruits in abundance. Thinking to make it even more productive, he deluges it with more than its proper share of the garden’s water, but the result is to make the fruits less delicious and the perfume of the flowers less delightful, and by degrees to desiccate the trees and dry up the vegetation.’</p>
                        <p>When the seven-man party heard these words, they instinctively stood up as though praying, along with the others. The philosopher later reported, ‘While all the others stood, I remained seated, seeking to understand the man and probe the wonders confronting us. Then he addressed me directly in a loud voice: “You there, with such a high opinion of yourself! Your greatest accomplishment has been to travel in thought between particular sensibles and general intelligibles and to extract therefrom knowledge that has given you insight into the nature of things that are perceptible to the senses and the like. You imagined that this would enable you to plumb the depths of cause and effect. In fact, you will attain nothing by that road, but only through the one whom I have placed between myself and my creation, to serve as a guide to my will. You should therefore seek him out more assiduously, and when you meet him, you may ask him about matters that exceed the scope of your knowledge, for I have graciously distinguished him from others and made him a sign of my generosity and a lodestar for sincere seekers after truth.” ’</p>
                        <p>‘He finished, and sat calmly, his gaze piercing. The people about him settled down and sat as before. I myself left, but returned that evening, and heard him addressing his friends and the seven messengers. Ascetic stuff, it was, about not yielding to the urges of the body. When he had finished speaking, I said to him, “I heard what you said earlier today, and I should like to ask you to expand on it for me.” “Everything you heard then,” he replied, “was merely something that took form in my mind and was uttered by my tongue without any volition on my part, even if you find that there is some food for thought in it.” I remained there for three days, urging the seven messengers to return home, but they would not go. On the fourth day, I went to visit the prophet, but hardly had I entered when he was taken with the same sort of narcoleptic fit as had befallen him on the earlier occasion when we had gone in all together to see him. But then he spoke: “O messenger of the sinful man, I perceive you are taking your time about returning to your master. Go back to your country, for he is no longer there; I am removing him in favour of a ruler who will see to it that the people for whom he is responsible are guided aright.” ’</p>
                        <p>‘At this, I left him and returned home, where I found that Marinus had died and had been succeeded by a middle-aged man of the same family who had righted injustices and taught the people to abandon their former love of luxury and idleness.’</p>

But God aided Islam and granted victory to His Messenger, peace be upon him, while the ranks of the unbelievers were shattered. The flower of Quraysh were killed, and a number of them were captured. Of the latter, some arranged for their release through the payment of ransom, while others were put to death at the orders of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and keep him, and these included ʿUqbah ibn Abī Muʿayṭ and al-Naḍr ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Kaladah, both of whom were executed after the battle was over and the Muslims had left Badr.

                        <p>Abū l-Faraj al-Iṣbahānī says, ‘I have heard that the Prophet, may God bless him and keep him, said, “If I had heard those lines before killing him, I would not have killed him.” ’ This elegy by Qutaylah is reputed to be the noblest, purest, most restrained and most dignified poetry ever uttered by a woman lamenting a murdered kinsman.</p>
                        <p>I – Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah – say: Evidently the reason why the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, waited until the Muslims had reached al-Ṣafrāʾ before having al-Naḍr ibn al-Ḥārith put to death was so that he could reflect on the proper course of action; having determined that he had made the right decision, he ordered his execution.</p>

Early in his career he lived in Alexandria, for he had a teaching post there, carrying on the tradition of the Alexandrians who have been mentioned earlier in this work. At that time, Egypt was ruled by Christian kings. However, when the Muslims conquered the country and became the rulers of Alexandria, Ibn Abjar converted to Islam at the instance of ʿUmar ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz,

If Ibn Abjar was already teaching before the Muslim conquest of Alexandria in 21/642 he was surely thirty by the time of the conquest. ʿUmar however was born c. 60/680; he was in Egypt only until 86/705. If Ibn Abjar converted at his hand, he must have been at a very advanced age. He cannot have remained the caliph’s physician. Sezgin,

                            informs us that he heard Ibn Abjar say: ‘Refrain from taking medicine as long as your body can bear the illness.’ This is similar to a well-known saying of the Prophet, may God bless him and keep him: ‘Drive your illness as far as it will carry you.’

                            he showed Ibn Uthāl particular favour, visiting him frequently and conversing with him in friendly fashion at all hours of the night and day. Muʿāwiyah’s reason for thus cultivating Ibn Uthāl was that the physician possessed extensive knowledge of the properties of simples and compound medicines, including highly toxic ones. Many prominent Muslims and persons of rank died of poisoning in Muʿāwiyah’s time.

He would like to designate his successor: whom will you have?” The people answered, “ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Khālid ibn al-Walīd.” Muʿāwiyah said nothing, keeping his intentions in the matter to himself, but he schemed to have the Christian physician Ibn Uthāl brought into the presence of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān. The physician gave him a dose of poison, and he died.’

If you see anything suspicious coming toward me, do whatever you have to do.’ When Ibn Uthāl came abreast of him, Khālid sprang upon him and stabbed him to death. The people who had been accompanying Ibn Uthāl came running up, but upon finding themselves confronted with Nāfiʿ, they fled, and Khālid and Nāfiʿ made their escape. The others came after them, but when they caught up with them, Khālid and Nāfiʿ turned upon them, and they dispersed. Finally they dodged into a narrow alleyway and gave their pursuers the slip.</p>

                            When Muʿāwiyah was told what had happened, he said, ‘This is the doing of Khālid ibn al-Muhājir. A narrow alley, you say? Look for him there.’ After a search, Khālid was taken and brought to Muʿāwiyah. ‘May God not reward you, O visitor,’ he said, ‘you have murdered my physician.’ ‘I have killed the one who was obeying an order,’ replied Khālid, ‘but not the one who gave the order.’ ‘God’s curse upon you,’ exclaimed the caliph. ‘I swear by God, had he testified even once that God is one and Muḥammad His Messenger, I would have you put to death. Where is your man Nāfiʿ?’ ‘I do not have him with me,’ said Khālid. ‘I fancy you do,’ said Muʿāwiyah, ‘for you would hardly have undertaken such a venture without him.’ He gave orders that a search should be made for Nāfiʿ, and when he was found and brought in, the caliph sentenced him to a hundred lashes. Khālid, for his part, did not have to endure anything more than a term of imprisonment.

                            When Muʿāwiyah heard these verses, he had Khālid released at once. Khālid returned to Mecca, and upon arriving there, he went to see ʿUrwah ibn al-Zubayr and said to him, ‘I have killed Ibn Uthāl, but what about Ibn Jurmūz,

He commanded a wing of ʿAlī’s troops at both the Battle of the Camel (36/656) and the Battle of Ṣiffīn in the following year. However, he and ʿAlī subsequently became estranged, for reasons that are not entirely clear, and after ʿAlī’s murder, Ibn ʿAbbās became friendly with Muʿāwiyah. See

                            called on Muʿāwiyah, the caliph would invite him to sit with him on his couch; he would then give permission for other visitors to come in and take their seats. When Ibn ʿAbbās came to see Muʿāwiyah after al-Ḥasan’s death, however, the caliph did not give him time to so much as utter a greeting. ‘Ibn ʿAbbās,’ he said, ‘have you heard? Al-Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī is dead.’ ‘No,’ said Ibn ʿAbbās. ‘I have just learned of his death,’ said Muʿāwiyah. ‘We are God’s, and to Him we shall return,’ said Ibn ʿAbbās. ‘O Muʿāwiyah,’ he went on, ‘his death will not serve to extend your own life, and his achievements will not go with him into the grave. We have been afflicted with a greater loss than this with the death of Muḥammad, may God bless him and keep him, yet God consoled our grief and did not destroy us afterward.’ ‘Will you not be seated, Ibn ʿAbbās?’ said Muʿāwiyah, but Ibn ʿAbbās retorted, ‘This is not a day in which to be seated.’

                                    I have also heard from ʿĪsā that once, while he and his father were out riding in the city of Damascus, they passed by the establishment of a cupper, with a great throng of people crowding around. Someone in the crowd noticed us and called out, ‘Make way there, make way, this is the famous physician Ḥakam and his son ʿĪsā.’ The crowd made way for us, and we saw a man whom the cupper had bled by opening his basilic vein.

                                    Now the basilic vein overlies an artery, and between making too wide an incision and not being sufficiently careful about determining the location of the vein, the cupper had nicked the artery, and was now unable to staunch the bleeding. We tried our usual methods, applying rags, cobweb and soft animal hair, to no avail. My father asked me if I could suggest any other recourse, but I replied that I knew of none. At that, he called for a pistachio nut. Cracking it in two, he discarded the kernel, took one of the two half-shells, and placed it on the site of the incision. Taking a strip of coarse linen torn from the hem of someone’s robe, he bound the arm so tightly with it, pressing the half-shell upon the incision, that the patient cried out, ‘Help!’ After having tightened the bandage even further, my father had the man carried to the Baradā River,

                                    where he ordered him to immerse his arm in the water. Making a smooth place on the riverbank, he told the patient to lie there, and he gave instructions that he should be fed soft-boiled egg yolks. Finally, he left one of his students to keep watch, telling him to be sure not to allow the patient to take the incised arm out of the water, except at prayer times, unless there appeared to be a serious risk of his dying of cold, in which case he might remove it for a short time, but he must immerse it again afterward. Thus matters remained until the end of the day. My father then sent the man home, instructing him not to cover the site of the incision or loosen the bandage for a full five days. The patient complied, but when my father went to see him on the third day, he found that both the forearm and the upper arm were greatly swollen. Accordingly, he loosened the bandage somewhat, saying to the man, ‘Some swelling is easier to bear than death.’ On the fifth day, he removed the bandage, and we found the pistachio shell stuck to the flesh. My father said to the man, ‘You have escaped death thanks to this shell. Do not remove it, but leave it strictly alone until it falls off of itself; otherwise, you are a dead man’.

                                <p>On the seventh day the shell fell off, revealing a thick scab the shape and size of a pistachio nut. My father told the patient not to fiddle with it, scratch the skin around it, or pick any of it off with his fingers. It gradually flaked away until, more than 40 days later, the site of the incision became visible, and the man had completely recovered.</p>

                                    She first asked ʿĪsā what treatment he considered appropriate. ‘This is such a severe colic,’ he replied, ‘that your life is in danger; it must be treated with an enema at once.’ She then turned to the two astrologers and asked them to select a suitable time for the procedure. Al-Abaḥḥ said, ‘Your illness is not of such a kind that you can afford to delay until some astrologer deems the time propitious. My view is that you should undergo treatment immediately, lest your condition become worse. That is what ʿĪsā ibn Ḥakam advises, and I concur.’

He replied, “Today, the moon is in conjunction with Saturn; tomorrow, it will be in conjunction with Jupiter. In my opinion, you should put off the treatment until then.”

                                    Al-Abaḥḥ broke in to say, “I fear that by the time the moon has closed with Jupiter, this colic will have progressed to such an extent that no treatment will be of any avail.” Both Ghaḍīḍ and her daughter, Umm Muḥammad, thought that that was an unlucky thing to say; they ordered al-Abaḥḥ to be shown out of the house, and Ghaḍīḍ announced that she would follow al-Ṭabarī’s advice. Before the moon had caught up with Jupiter, however, Ghaḍīḍ had died. When the moon was in conjunction with Jupiter, al-Abaḥḥ sent a message to Umm Muḥammad, saying, “This is the time selected by al-Ṭabarī for the treatment: where is our patient?” This message enraged Umm Muḥammad even further, and she remained hostile to al-Abaḥḥ to the day of her death.’

                                <p>In the year 225/840, suffering from a bad head cold, I went to stay with ʿĪsā ibn Ḥakam at his home in Damascus. He gave me savoury food to eat and snow-cooled water to drink. When I objected that such dainty fare was harmful in the case of a cold, he countered that it all depended on the climate. ‘I know more than you do about the climate of my country,’ he said, ‘and things that are harmful in Iraq are beneficial here in Damascus.’ Accordingly, I ate the food that was placed before me. When I left the region, he accompanied me as far as a place named al-Rāhib. As we were parting company, he said to me, ‘I have prepared a parcel of food for you to take with you. It does not contain the same kinds of food that you ate while you were staying in my house. From now on, do not touch those kinds of food, and do not drink any cold water.’ When I asked him indignantly why he had feasted me as he had, he replied, ‘It is unbecoming for a rational man to require a guest in his house to follow the rules of the art of medicine.’</p>

                                    Once, in Damascus, ʿĪsā and I fell into a discussion about onions. He launched into a diatribe against the things, listing various reasons why they were to be regarded as unwholesome. I should mention here that ʿĪsā and Salmawayh ibn Bunān

                                    lived like monks and never had a good word to say about foods that promoted sexual activity, holding that it made bodies die and souls perish. I did not think it appropriate to discuss the onion’s ability to enhance sexual performance; I simply commented that in the course of my present trip from Samarra to Damascus I had personally experienced one beneficial property of onions. ‘What was that?’ he asked, and I told him that I had tasted the water of a certain well along the way and found it to be brackish, but that after having eaten some raw onions, I had tasted the water again and found it noticeably less brackish. ʿĪsā was seldom heard to laugh, but he burst out laughing at that. Then a concerned look came over his face, and he said, ‘I am distressed to see a man of your intelligence go so wrong. You encountered the very least attractive feature of onions, their very worst defect, and mistook it for a virtue. Is it not true that when some disturbance befalls the brain, the senses – smell, taste, hearing and sight – are adversely affected?’ I acknowledged that that was indeed the case. ‘You see,’ he said, ‘one of the properties of onions is that they induce a disturbance in the brain, and that is what happened to you. You perceived the water to be less brackish only because the onions you had eaten had perturbed the functioning of your brain.’

                                <p>When ʿĪsā accompanied me to al-Rāhib, his final words to me were, ‘My father died at the age of a hundred and five, his face unwrinkled and its brightness undimmed, thanks to some practices of his. I shall now tell you what they were, and recommend that you follow them: never to eat dried salt meat, and to wash the hands and feet with water as cold as you can bear upon emerging from the bath. If you do these things, you will find them beneficial.’ I have followed his advice, except that I have sometimes sucked on a small piece of dried salt meat, perhaps once in the course of a year or longer.</p>

                            had appointed governor, and served him faithfully with his knowledge of the art of medicine. Al-Ḥajjāj relied on Tayādhūq and had confidence in his treatment, and consequently paid him lavishly and provided abundantly for all his needs.

                        <p>Tayādhūq provided al-Ḥajjāj with much medical advice, including, ‘Marry none but a young woman; eat only meat from a young animal, and make sure it is well cooked; drink medicine only if you are ill; eat none but ripe fruit; chew your food thoroughly; when you eat a meal during the day, there is no harm in having a nap, but when you eat a meal at night, do not go to bed without having gone for a walk, even if it is no more than fifty paces.’</p>
                        <p>On one occasion, this advice drew the following comment from a bystander: ‘If the matter is as you say, how is it that Hippocrates is dead, Galen is dead, and all the others are dead? Not one of them is left; how can that be?’ Tayādhūq replied, ‘A fair question, young man. Now, pay attention: they managed their lives well in so far as it was in their power to do so, but they were overcome by things over which they had no control.’ By that he meant death and external accidents such as heat, cold, falling, drowning, injury, grief and the like.</p>

                            Tayādhūq also gave al-Ḥajjāj the following admonitions: ‘Do not eat until you are hungry; do not engage in sexual relations if you feel reluctant; never hold in your urine; and always remember that the bath is a good servant but a bad master’.

                            ‘Yes, indeed,’ Tayādhūq replied, ‘for a man such as yourself, O emir, it is called will-power!’ Al-Ḥajjāj immediately dropped the lump of clay that he was holding and never ate clay again.
                        </p>
                        <p>One day, al-Ḥajjāj was suffering from a bad headache. He summoned Tayādhūq, who advised him to bathe his feet in hot water and then to rub them with oil. One of al-Ḥajjāj’s eunuchs who was present at the time remarked, ‘By God, I have never seen a physician so clearly lacking in knowledge of the art of medicine. Here is the emir with a headache, and the remedy you prescribe is all about his feet!’ ‘And why not?’ Tayādhūq retorted, ‘consider your own case.’ ‘How do you mean?’ the eunuch asked. ‘Why,’ said Tayādhūq, ‘here your testicles have been removed, and see! the hairs of your beard have all fallen out.’ Al-Ḥajjāj and all the company laughed heartily at this.</p>
                        <p>
                            Another time, al-Ḥajjāj sent for Tayādhūq and informed him that he was troubled with weakness of the stomach and dyspepsia. ‘I advise the emir,’ said the physician, ‘to have pistachio nuts with red outer shells
                            <note n="7" type="footnote">
                                <p>The outer shells of pistachios turn yellow or red when the nuts are fully ripe.</p>

                            brought to him, crack them open, and eat the kernels; that will strengthen his stomach.’ That evening, al-Ḥajjāj sent word to all his concubines that his physician had prescribed pistachio nuts, whereupon each of them sent him a dish full of shelled pistachio kernels, on which he gorged. This brought on a bout of diarrhoea and vomiting (
                            <hi rend="italic">hayḍah</hi>
                            ) from which he nearly died. He complained to Tayādhūq that the pistachio treatment had made his condition worse, and told him what had occurred. ‘I told you to send for some pistachio nuts in their shells,’ Tayādhūq replied, ‘and to crack them open one by one, for in biting the shells you would have absorbed something of the aromatic and binding substances in them, which fortify the stomach. You did not follow my advice,’ and he proceeded to treat al-Ḥajjāj for his attack of diarrhoea.

                        <p>A certain king is said to have asked Tayādhūq for advice when he saw that the physician had reached a great age, for he was more skilful and learned than any other practitioner of that age, and the king feared that there would be no one of equal stature to succeed him when he died. Accordingly, he went to Tayādhūq and said to him, ‘Give me some precepts upon which I can rely and which I can use to guide my life and apply as long as I live, for there can be no certainty that you will not die, and if you do, I may be unable to find anyone as skilled as you.’</p>
                        <p>Tayādhūq replied, ‘Majesty, it is my pleasure to state ten precepts for you, which you should mark well. Avoid these things, and you will never fall ill as long as you live. Eat nothing if you already have food in your stomach. Do not swallow anything that your teeth are unable to chew, as it will cause cramps in your stomach. After eating, drink no water until two hours have elapsed, for dyspepsia is the origin of disease, and food followed by water is the origin of dyspepsia. Go to the bath once every other day; hygiene will eliminate what medicine cannot. Augmenting the blood in your body will preserve your life. Take an emetic and a laxative in every season of the year. Never try to hold in your urine, not even while riding. Always visit the latrine before going to bed. Do not engage too frequently in sexual activity, for whether frequent or infrequent, it draws upon the fire of life. Lastly, sexual congress with an old woman is sudden death.’</p>
                        <p>When the king heard this, he ordered his secretary to write it all down in letters of red gold and to deposit the manuscript in a chest inlaid with gold. He consulted the precepts every day and applied them scrupulously, with the result that he never had a day’s illness in his entire life, until he was overtaken by ineluctable death, from which there can be no escape.</p>

I have followed them scrupulously, and they have invariably done me good. I went to visit him when he lay near death, and he said to me, “Be sure to follow those recommendations of mine, and do not forget them.” So remember always: never drink medicine unless you need it; never eat food while there is already food in your stomach; after every meal, go for a walk forty paces in length; when you are full of food, sleep on your left side; never eat fruit once it has begun to spoil; eat only the meat of young animals; do not have sex with an old woman; clean your teeth with a tooth-stick; and after you have eaten meat, do not eat more meat, for that is enough to kill a lion in the desert.’
