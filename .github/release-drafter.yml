  This release is intended for testing data to be released on the [Usaybia.net](https://usaybia.net) website. 

  It includes person records, place records, bibliography records, some marked-up Arabic text, and some factoids.

  The .xar package is intended to be used in [eXist-db 5.x](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html) with the [Srophé app Usaybia fork](https://github.com/usaybia/srophe-eXist-app).

  You can also make your own .xar of the data by downloading this repo and running ant in the repo directory. A docker image of eXist-db with this package pre-installed is available at https://github.com/orgs/usaybia/packages/container/package/usaybia-data.
